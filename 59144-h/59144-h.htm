<h3>THE MASTER OF GREYLANDS.</h3>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h4><a name="div1_01" href="#div1Ref_01">CHAPTER I.</a></h4>
<h5>IN THE BANK PARLOUR.</h5>
<br>

<p>Stilborough. An old-fashioned market-town of some importance in its district,
but not the chief town of the county. It was market-day: Thursday: and the
streets wore an air of bustle, farmers and other country people passing and
repassing from the corn-market to their respective inns, or perhaps from their
visit, generally a weekly one, to the banker's.</p>
<p>In the heart of the town, where the street was wide and the buildings were
good, stood the bank. It was nearly contiguous to the town-hall on the one hand,
and to the old church of St. Mark on the other, and was opposite the new
market-house, where the farmers' wives and daughters sat with their butter and
poultry. For in those days--many a year ago now--people had not leaped up above
their sphere; and the farmers' wives would have thought they were going to ruin
outright had anybody but themselves kept market. A very large and handsome
house, this bank, the residence of its owner and master, Mr. Peter Castlemaine.</p>
<p>No name stood higher than Mr. Peter Castlemaine's. Though of sufficiently
good descent, he was, so to say, a self-made man. Beginning in a small way in
early life, he had risen by degrees to what he now was--to what he had long
been--the chief banker in the county. People left the county-town to bank with
him; in all his undertakings he was supposed to be flourishing; in realized
funds a small millionaire.</p>
<p>The afternoon drew to a close; the business of the day was over; the clerks
were putting the last touches to their accounts previously to departing, and Mr.
Peter Castlemaine sat alone in his private room. It was a spacious apartment,
comfortably and even luxuriously furnished for a room devoted solely to business
purposes. But the banker had never been one of those who seem to think that a
hard chair and a bare chamber are necessary to the labour that brings success.
The rich crimson carpet with its soft thick rug threw a warmth of colouring on
the room, the fire flashed and sparkled in the grate: for the month was February
and the weather yet wintry.</p>
<p>Before his own desk, in a massive and luxurious arm-chair, sat Mr. Peter
Castlemaine. He was a tall, slender, and handsome man, fifty-one years of age
this same month. His hair was dark, his eyes were brown, his good complexion was
yet clear and bright. In manner he was a courteous man, but naturally a silent
one; rather remarkably so; his private character and his habits were
unexceptionable.</p>
<p>No one had ever a moment's access to this desk at which he sat: even his
confidential old clerk could not remember to have been sent to it for any paper
or deed that might be wanted in the public rooms. The lid of the desk drew over
and closed with a spring, so that in one instant its contents could be hidden
from view and made safe and fast. The long table in the middle of the room was
to-day more than usually covered with papers; a small marble slab between Mr.
Peter Castlemaine's left hand and the wall held sundry open ledgers piled one
upon another, to which he kept referring. Column after column of figures: the
very sight of them enough to give an unfinancial man the nightmare: but the
banker ran his fingers up and down the rows at railroad speed, for, to him, it
was mere child's-play. Seldom has there existed a clearer head for his work than
that of Peter Castlemaine. But for that fact he might not have been seated where
he was to-day, the greatest banker for miles round.</p>
<p>And yet, as he sat there, surrounded by these marks and tokens of wealth and
power, his face presented a sad contrast to them and to the ease and luxury of
the room. Sad, careworn, anxious, looked he; and, as he now and again paused in
his work to pass his hand over his brow, a heavy sigh escaped him. The more he
referred to his ledgers, and compared them with figures and papers on the desk
before him, so much the more perplexed and harassed did his face become. In his
eyes there was the look of a hunted animal, the look of a drowning man catching
at a straw, the look that must have been in the eyes of poor Louis Dixhuit when
they discovered him in his disguise and turned his horses' heads backwards. At
last, throwing down his pen, he fell back in his chair, and hid his face in his
hands.</p>
<p>&quot;No escape,&quot; he murmured, &quot;no escape! Unless a miracle should supervene, I am
undone.&quot;</p>
<p>He remained in this attitude, that told so unmistakably of despair, for some
minutes, revolving many things: problems working themselves in and out of his
brain confusedly, as a man works in and out of a labyrinth, to which he has lost
the clue. A small clock on the mantelpiece struck the hour, five, and then
chimed an air once popular in France. It was a costly trifle that the banker had
bought years ago. Paintings, articles of virtu, objets de luxe, had always
possessed attractions for him.</p>
<p>The chimes aroused him. &quot;I must talk to Hill,&quot; he muttered: &quot;no use putting
it off till another day.&quot; And he touched the spring of his small hand-bell.</p>
<p>In answer, the door opened, and there entered a little elderly man with
snow-white hair worn long behind, and a good-looking, fair, and intellectual
face, its eyes beaming with benevolence. He wore a black tail coat, according to
the custom of clerks of that day, and a white cambric frilled shirt like that of
his master. It was Thomas Hill; for many years Mr. Peter Castlemaine's
confidential clerk and right hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Come in, Hill; come in,&quot; said the banker. &quot;Close the door--and lock it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The clerks are gone, sir; the last has just left,&quot; was the reply. But the
old man nevertheless turned the key of the door.</p>
<p>Mr. Peter Castlemaine pointed to a seat close to him; and his clerk, quiet in
all his movements, as in the tones of his voice, took it in silence. For a full
minute they looked at each other; Thomas Hill's face reflecting the uneasiness
of his master's. He was the first to speak.</p>
<p>&quot;I know it, sir,&quot; he said, his manner betraying the deepest respect and
sympathy. &quot;I have seen it coming for a long while. So have you, sir. Why have
you not confided in me before?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I <i>could</i> not,&quot; breathed Mr. Peter Castlemaine. &quot;I wanted to put it
from me, Hill, as a thing that could never really be. It has never come so near
as it has come now, Hill; it has never been so real as at this moment of
outspoken words.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was not my place to take the initiative, sir; but I was wishing always
that you would speak to me. I could but place facts and figures before you and
point to results, compare past balances with present ones, other years'
speculations with last year's, and--and give you the opportunity of opening the
subject with me. But you never would open it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have told you why, Hill,&quot; said Peter Castlemaine. &quot;I strove to throw the
whole trouble from me. It was a weak, mistaken feeling; nine men out of every
ten would have been actuated by it under similar circumstances. And yet,&quot; he
continued, half in soliloquy, &quot;I never was much like other men, and I never knew
myself to be weak.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Never weak; never weak,&quot; responded the faithful clerk, affectionately.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know, Hill; I feel so now. This has been to me long as a far-off
monster, creeping onwards by degrees, advancing each day by stealthy steps more
ominously near: and now it is close at hand, ready to crush me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I seem not to understand it,&quot; said poor Hill.</p>
<p>&quot;And there are times when I cannot,&quot; returned Mr. Peter Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;In the old days, sir, everything you handled turned to gold. You had but to
take up a speculation, and it was sure to prove a grand success. Why, sir, your
name has become quite a proverb for luck. If Castlemaine the banker's name is to
it, say people of any new undertaking, it must succeed. But for some time past
things have changed, and instead of success, it has been failure. Sir, it is
just as though your hand had lost its cunning.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right, Hill,&quot; sighed his master, &quot;my hand seems to have lost its cunning. It
is--I have said it over and over again to myself--just as though some curse
pursued me. Ill-luck; nothing but ill-luck! If a scheme has looked fair and
promising to-day, a blight has fallen on it to-morrow. And I, like a fool, as I
see now, plunged into fresh ventures, hoping to redeem the last one. How few of
us are there who know how to pull up in time! Were all known the public would
say that the mania of gambling must have taken hold of me----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, no,&quot; murmured the clerk.</p>
<p>&quot;----When it was but the recklessness of a drowning man. Why, Hill--if I
could get in the money at present due to me, money that I think will come in,
perhaps shortly, though it is locked up now, we should weather the storm.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I trust it will be weathered, sir, somehow. At the worst, it will not be a
bad failure; there'll be twenty shillings in the pound if they will but wait.
Perhaps, if you called a private meeting and pointed things out, and showed them
that it is only time you want, they'd consent to let you have it. Matters would
go on then, and there'd be no exposure.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is the want of time that will crush me,&quot; said Peter Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;But if they will allow you time, sir?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All will not,&quot; was the significant answer, and Mr. Peter Castlemaine lowered
his voice as he spoke it, and looked full at his clerk. &quot;You know those Armannon
bonds?&quot;</p>
<p>Whether it was the tone, the look, or the question, certain it was that in
that instant an awful dread, an instinct of evil, seized upon the old man. His
face turned white.</p>
<p>&quot;I had to <i>use</i> those bonds, Hill,&quot; whispered his master. &quot;To mortgage
them, you understand. But, as I am a living man, I believed when I did it that
in less than a week they would be redeemed and replaced.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mortgaged the Armannon bonds!&quot; ejaculated Thomas Hill, utterly unable to
take in the fact, and looking the picture of horror.</p>
<p>&quot;And they are not yet redeemed.&quot;</p>
<p>The clerk wrung his hands. &quot;My master! my friend and master! How could you?
Surely it was done in a moment of madness!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of weakness, of wickedness, if you will, Thomas, but not madness. I was as
sane as I am now. You remember the large payment we had to make last August? It
<i>had</i> to be made, you know, or things would have come to a crisis then. I
used the bonds to raise the money.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I--I cannot comprehend,&quot; returned the clerk slowly, after casting his
recollection back. &quot;I thought you borrowed that money from Mr. Castlemaine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No. Mr. Castlemaine would not lend it me. I don't know whether he smelt a
rat and got afraid for the rest I hold of his. What he said was, that he had not
so large a sum at his disposal. Or, it may be,&quot; added the banker in a dreamy
kind of tone, &quot;that James thought I was only going into some fresh speculation,
and considers I am rich enough already. How little he knows!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, but these deeds must be redeemed!&quot; cried the old clerk, rising from his
seat in excitement. &quot;At all sacrifice they must be got back, sir. If you have to
sell up all, houses, land, and everything, they must be returned to their safe
resting-place. You must not longer run this dreadful risk, sir: the fear of it
would bring me down in suspense and sorrow to my grave.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then, what do you suppose it has been doing for me?&quot; rejoined Mr. Peter
Castlemaine. &quot;Many a time and oft since, I have said to myself, 'Next week shall
see those bonds replaced.' But the 'next week' has never come: for I have had to
use all available cash to prop up the falling house and keep it from sinking.
Once down, Hill, the truth about the bonds could no longer be concealed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You must sell all, sir.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<i>There's nothing left to sell, Thomas</i>,&quot; said his master. &quot;At least,
nothing immediately available. It is <i>time</i> that is wanted. Given that, I
could put things straight again.&quot;</p>
<p>A trying silence. Thomas Hill's face was full of pain and dread. &quot;I have a
little accumulated money of my own, sir: some of it I've saved, some came to me
when my brother died,&quot; he said. &quot;It is about six thousand pounds, and I have
neither chick nor child. Every shilling of it shall be yours, sir, as soon as I
can withdraw it from where it is invested.&quot;</p>
<p>His master grasped his hands. &quot;Faithful man and friend!&quot; he cried, the tears
of emotion dimming his brown eyes. &quot;Do you think I would accept the sacrifice
and bring you to ruin as I have brought myself? Never that, Hill.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The money shall be yours, sir,&quot; repeated the clerk firmly.</p>
<p>&quot;Hush, hush!&quot; cried Mr. Peter Castlemaine. &quot;Though I were dying of shame and
hunger, I would not take it. And, do you not see, my friend, that it would be a
useless sacrifice? Six thousand pounds would be swallowed up unheeded in the
vortex: it would be but as a drop of water to the heaving ocean.&quot;</p>
<p>It was even so. Thomas Hill saw it. They sat down together and went into the
books: the banker showing him amounts and involvements that he had never
suspected before. The ruin seemed to be close at hand; there seemed to be no
possible way out of it. Common ruin Thomas Hill might have got over in time; but
this ruin, the ruin that threatened his master, would have turned his hair white
in a night had time not already turned it.</p>
<p>And crimes were more heavily punished in those days than they are in these.</p>
<p>At a quarter to six o'clock, Peter Castlemaine was in his dining-room,
dressed for dinner. He often had friends to dine with him on market-days, and
was expecting some that night: a small social party of half a dozen, himself
included. He stood with his back to the fire, his brow smoothed, his aspect that
of complete ease; he could hear his butler coming up the stairs to show in the
first guest. All the dwelling-rooms were on this first floor, the ground-floor
being entirely appropriated to business.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Castlemaine.&quot;</p>
<p>The two brothers met in the middle of the room and shook hands. Mr.
Castlemaine was the elder by two years, but he did not look so, and there was a
very great likeness between them. Fine, upright, handsome men, both; with clear,
fresh faces, well-cut features, and keen, flashing, dark eyes. Very pleasant men
to talk to; but silent men as to their own affairs. Mr. Castlemaine had just
come in from his residence, Greylands' Rest: it was in contradistinction to him
that the banker was invariably called Mr. <i>Peter</i> Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;All well at home, James?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Quite so, thank you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You were not in at market, to-day.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No: I had nothing particular to call me in. Are you expecting a large party
this evening?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Only six of us. Here comes another.&quot;</p>
<p>The butler's step was again heard. But this time he came, not to announce a
guest, but to bring a note, just delivered. Peter Castlemaine's hand shook
slightly as he opened it. He dreaded all letters now. It proved, however, to be
only an excuse from one of the expected guests: and a strange relief sat on his
face as he turned to his brother.</p>
<p>&quot;Lawrence can't come, James. So there'll be but five of us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lawrence is not much loss,&quot; said Mr. Castlemaine, &quot;You don't look quite
yourself, Peter,&quot; he added, to his brother; something in the latter's
countenance having struck his observant eye. &quot;I think you are working too hard;
have thought so for some time. Don't let the love of money take all pleasure out
of life. Surely you must have made enough, and might now take some rest.&quot;</p>
<p>The banker laughed. &quot;As to taking rest, that's easier recommended than done,
James. I am too young to give up work yet: I should be like a fish out of
water.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah well--we are all, I expect, wedded to our work--whatever it may be:
creatures of habit,&quot; admitted Mr. Castlemaine. &quot;I will just go and see Mary
Ursula. She in her room, I suppose. What a treasure you possess in that girl,
Peter!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Beyond the wealth of Solomon; beyond all price,&quot; was the impulsive answer,
and Peter Castlemaine's face glowed as he made it. &quot;Yes, you will find her in
her room, James.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Castlemaine went to the end of the wide and handsome passage,--its walls
lined with paintings, its floor covered with a carpet, rich and soft as
moss,--and knocked at a door there. A sweet voice bade him enter.</p>
<p>The small, choice room was brilliantly lighted with wax tapers; the fire
threw a warmth on its dainty furniture. A stately lady, tall, slight, and very
beautiful, who had been working at a sketch, put down her pencil, and rose. It
was Miss Castlemaine, the banker's only child: as fair a picture as could be
found in the world. She wore a white muslin dress, made low in the fashion of
the day. On her queen-like neck was a string of pearls; bracelets of pearls
clasped her pretty arms. Her face was indeed beautiful: it was like her father's
face, but more delicately carved; the complexion was of a paler and fairer tint;
the brown eyes, instead of flashing, as his did in his youth, had a subdued,
almost a sad look in them. It was one of the sweetest faces ever seen, but
altogether its pervading expression was that of sadness: an expression that in
her childhood had led many an old woman to say, &quot;She is too good to live.&quot; She
had lived, however, in the best of strength and health, until now, when she was
in her five-and-twentieth year. An accomplished lady, she, very much so for
those days, and of great good sense; her conversational powers rare; a sound
musician, and a fair linguist, fond of sketching and painting in watercolours.
With it all, she was particularly gentle in manner, modest and retiring as a
woman should be: there was at all times a repose upon her that seemed to exhale
repose, and was most charming. Her father loved her with an ardent love; he had
lost his wife, and this child was all-in-all to him. But for her sake, he might
not have dreaded the coming disgrace with the intense horror he did dread it.
His happiest hours were spent with her. In the twilight he would sit in the
music-room, listening to her playing on the piano, or on the sweet-toned organ
he had had built for her--the tones not more sweet, though, than her own voice
when raised in song. Her gift of extemporising was of no mean order; and as the
banker sat listening to the organ's sounds, its rise and fall, its swelling and
dying away, he would forget his cares. She was engaged to William Blake-Gordon,
the eldest son of Sir Richard Blake-Gordon; a poor, but very haughty baronet,
unduly proud of his descent. But for the vast amount of money Miss Castlemaine
was expected to inherit, Sir Richard had never condescended to give his consent
to the match: but the young man loved her for her own sake. Just now Miss
Castlemaine was alone: the lady, Mrs. Webb, who resided with her as chaperon and
companion, having been called away by the illness of a near relative. One word
as to her name--Mary Ursula. A somewhat long name to pronounce, but it was
rarely shortened by her relatives. The name had been old Mrs. Castlemaine's, her
grandmother's, and was revered in the Castlemaine family.</p>
<p>&quot;I knew it was you, Uncle James,&quot; she said, meeting him with both hands
extended. &quot;I knew you would come in to see me.&quot;</p>
<p>He took her hands into one of his and touched fondly her beautiful hair, that
so well set-off the small and shapely head, and kissed her tenderly. Mr.
Castlemaine was fond of his niece, and very proud of her.</p>
<p>&quot;Your face is cold, Uncle James.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fresh with the out-of-door cold, my dear. I walked in.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All the way from Greylands!&quot;</p>
<p>He laughed at her &quot;all the way.&quot; It was but three miles; scarcely that. &quot;I
felt inclined for the walk, Mary Ursula. The carriage will come in to take me
home.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is Ethel well, Uncle James? And Mrs. Castlemaine?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Quite so, my dear. What are you doing here?&quot;</p>
<p>She had sat down to the table again, and he bent his head over her to look at
her drawing. There was a moment's silence.</p>
<p>&quot;Why it is--it is the Friar's Keep!&quot; exclaimed Mr. Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she answered. &quot;I sketched its outlines when at your house last summer,
and I have never filled it in until now.&quot;</p>
<p>She sketched as she did everything else--almost perfectly. The resemblance
was exact, and Mr. Castlemaine said so. &quot;It seems to me already completed!&quot; he
observed.</p>
<p>&quot;All but the shading of the sky in the back-ground.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why have you made those two windows darker than the rest?&quot;</p>
<p>Miss Castlemaine smiled as she answered jestingly, &quot;I thought there should be
no opportunity given for the appearance of the Grey Friar in my drawing, Uncle
James.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Castlemaine drew in his lips with a peculiar twist. The jest pleased him.</p>
<p>&quot;Have you seen much of the Grey Sisters lately, Uncle James?&quot;</p>
<p><i>This</i> did not please him. And Mary Ursula, as she caught the
involuntary frown that knitted his bold brow, felt vexed to have asked the
question. Not for the first time, as she well recalled, had Mr. Castlemaine
shown displeasure at the mention of the &quot;Grey Sisters.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why do you not like them, Uncle James?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot help thinking that Greylands might get on better if it were rid of
them,&quot; was the short reply of Mr. Castlemaine. But he passed at once from the
subject.</p>
<p>&quot;And we are not to have this fair young lady-hostess at the dinner-table's
head to-night?&quot; he cried, in a different and a warm tone, as he gazed
affectionately at his niece. &quot;Mary Ursula, it is a sin. I wish some customs were
changed! And you will be all alone!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;'Never less alone than when alone,'&quot; quoted Mary Ursula: &quot;and that is true
of me, uncle mine. But to-night I shall not be alone in any sense, for Agatha
Mountsorrel is coming to bear me company.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Agatha Mountsorrel! I don't care for her, Mary Ursula. She is desperately
high and mighty.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All the Mountsorrels are that--with their good descent and their wealth, I
suppose they think they have cause for it--but I like her. And I fancy that is
her carriage stopping now. There's six o'clock, uncle; and you will be keeping
the soup waiting.&quot;</p>
<p>Six was striking from the room's silver-gilt timepiece. &quot;I suppose I must
go,&quot; said Mr. Castlemaine. &quot;I'd rather stay and spend the evening with you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Uncle James, think of the baked meats!&quot; she laughed. &quot;Of the
nectar-cup!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What are baked meats and a nectar-cup to the brightness of thine eyes, to
the sweet discourse of thy lips? There's not thy peer in this world, Mary
Ursula.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uncle, uncle, you would spoil me. Flattery is like a subtle poison, that in
time destroys sound health.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fare you well, my dear. I will come and say goodnight to you before I
leave.&quot;</p>
<p>As Mr. Castlemaine trod the corridor, he met Miss Mountsorrel coming up: a
handsome, haughty girl in a scarlet cloak and hood. She returned his salute with
a sweeping bow, and passed on her way in silence.</p>
<p>T tie dinner was one of those perfect little repasts that the banker was
renowned for. The three other guests were Sir Richard Blake-Gordon; the Reverend
John Marston, vicar of St. Mark's and also of Greylands, generally called by the
public &quot;Parson Mas'on;&quot; and Mr. Knivett, family solicitor to the Castlemaines.
The wines were excellent; the reunion was altogether sociable and pleasant; and
the banker's brow gave no indication of the strife within. It's true Mr. Marston
took his full share of the wine--as many a parson then appeared to think it
quite religious to do--and talked rather too much accordingly. But the guests
enjoyed themselves and broke up before eleven. Mr. Castlemaine, who could drink
his wine with any man, but took care never to take more than he could carry as a
gentleman, proceeded to his niece's room to say goodnight to her; as he had
promised to do.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope I have not kept you up, my dear,&quot; he began as he entered.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh no, Uncle James,&quot; was Mary Ursula's answer. &quot;I never go to bed until I
have sung the evening hymn to papa.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where's Miss Mountsorrel?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The carriage came for her at ten o'clock.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And pray where's Master William, that he has not been here this evening?&quot;</p>
<p>She blushed like a summer rose. &quot;Do you think he is here <i>every</i>
evening, Uncle James? Mrs. Webb warned him in time that it would not be
etiquette, especially while she was away. And how have you enjoyed yourself?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Passably. The baked meats you spoke of were tempting; the nectar good. Of
which nectar, in the shape of a dinner port, the parson took slightly more than
was necessary. What toast, do you suppose, he suddenly gave us?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How can I tell, Uncle James?&quot; she rejoined, looking up.</p>
<p>&quot;We were talking of you at the moment, and the parson rose to his legs, his
glass in his hand. 'Here's to the fairest and sweetest maiden in the universe,'
said he, 'and may she soon be Lady Blake-Gordon!'&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, how could he!&quot; exclaimed Miss Castlemaine, colouring painfully in her
distress. &quot;And Sir Richard present!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As to Sir Richard, I thought he was going frantic. You know what he is.
'Zounds! Sir Parson,' he cried, starting up in his turn, 'do you wish me dead?
Is it not enough that the young lady should first become <i>Mistress</i>
Blake-Gordon? Am I so old and useless as to be wished out of the world for the
sake of my son's aggrandisement?'--and so on. Marston pacified him at last,
protesting that he had only said Mistress Blake-Gordon; or that, if he had not,
he had meant to say it. And now, goodnight, my dear, for I don't care to keep my
horses standing longer in the cold. When are you coming to stay at Greylands'
Rest?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Whenever you like to invite me, Uncle James. I wish you could get papa over
for a week. It would give him rest: and he has not appeared to be well of late.
He seems full of care.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of business, my dear; not care. Though, of course, undertakings such as his
must bring care with them. You propose it to him; and come with him: if he will
come for anybody's asking, it is yours.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You will give my love to Ethel; and----&quot;</p>
<p>Castlemaine, stooping to kiss her, arrested the words with a whisper.</p>
<p>&quot;When is it to be, Mary Ursula? When shall we be called upon to congratulate
Mistress Blake-Gordon? Soon?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh uncle, I don't know.&quot; And she laughed and blushed, and felt confused at
the outspoken words: but in her inmost heart was as happy as a queen.</p>

<h5>THE GREY LADIES.</h5>
<br>

<p>A romantic, picturesque fishing village was that of Greylands, as secluded as
any English village can well be. Stilborough was an inland town; Greylands was
built on the sea-coast. The London coaches, on their way from Stilborough to the
great city, would traverse the nearly three miles of dreary road intervening
between the town and the village, dash suddenly, as it were, upon the sea on
entering the village, and then turn sharply off in its midst by the Dolphin Inn,
and go on its inland road again. As to London, it was so far off, or seemed so
in those quiet, non-travelling days, that the villagers would as soon have
expected to undertake a journey to the moon.</p>
<p>The first object to be seen on drawing near to Greylands from Stilborough,
was the small church; an old stone building on the left hand, with its graveyard
around it. On the opposite side of the road the cliffs rose high, and the sea
could not be seen for them. The Reverend John Marston held the living of
Greylands in conjunction with St. Mark's at Stilborough: the two had always gone
together, and the combined income was but poor. Mr. Marston was fond of
fox-hunting in winter, and of good dinners at all seasons: as many other parsons
were. Greylands did not get much benefit from him. He was non-resident, as the
parsons there had always been, for he lived at St. Mark's. Of course, with two
churches and only one parson to serve both, the services could but clash, for
nobody can be doing duty in two places at once. Once a month, on the <i>third</i>
Sunday, Mr. Marston scuffled over to Greylands to hold morning service,
beginning at twelve, he having scuffled through the prayers (no sermon that day)
at St. Mark's first. On the three other Sundays he held the Greylands service at
three in the afternoon. So that, except for this Sunday service, held at
somewhat uncertain hours--for the easy-going parson did not always keep his
time, and on occasion had been known to fail altogether--Greylands was
absolutely without pastoral care.</p>
<p>Descending onwards--an abrupt descent--past the church, the cliffs on the
right soon ended abruptly; and the whole village, lying in its hollow, seemed to
burst upon you all at once. It was very open, very wide just there. The beach
lay flat and bare to the sea, sundry fishing-boats being high and dry there:
others would be out at sea, catching fish. Huts and cottages were built on the
side of the rocks; and some few on the beach. On the left stood the Dolphin Inn,
looking straight across the wide road to the beach and the sea; past which inn
the coach-road branched off inland again.</p>
<p>The village street--if it could be called a street--continued to wind on, up
the village, the Dolphin Inn making a corner, as it were, between the street and
the inland coach-road. Let us follow this street. It is steep and winding, and
for a short distance solitary. Halfway up the ascent, on the left, and built on
the sea-coast, rises the pile of old buildings called the Grey Nunnery. This
pile stands back from the road across a narrow strip of waste land on which
grass grows. The cliff is low there, understand, and the Grey Nunnery's built
right at the edge, so that the waves dash against its lower walls at high water.
The back of the building is to the road, the front to the sea. A portion of it
is in ruins; but this end is quite habitable, and in it live some ladies,
twelve, who are called the Grey Sisters, or sometimes the Grey Ladies, and who
devote themselves to charity and to doing good. In spite of the appellation,
they are of the Reformed Faith; strict, sound Protestants: a poor community as
to funds, but rich in goodness. They keep a few beds for the sick among the
villagers, or for accidents; and they have a day school for the village
children. If they could get better children to educate, they would be glad; and
some of the ladies are accomplished gentlewomen. Mr. Castlemaine, who is, so to
say, head and chief of the village of Greylands, looking down on it from his
mansion, Greylands' Rest, does not countenance these Sisters: he discountenances
them, in fact, and has been heard to ridicule the ladies. The Master of
Greylands, the title generally accorded him, is no unmeaning appellation, for in
most things his will is law. Beyond the part of the building thus inhabited,
there is a portion that lies in complete ruin; it was the chapel in the days of
the monks, but its walls are but breast-high now; and beyond it comes another
portion, still in tolerable preservation, called the Friar's Keep. The Friar's
Keep was said to have gained its appellation from the fact that the confessor to
the convent lived in it, together with some holy men, his brethren. A vast pile
of buildings it must have been in its prime; and some of the traditions said
that this Friar's Keep was in fact a monastery, divided from the nunnery by the
chapel. A wild, desolate, grand place it must have been, looking down on the
turbulent sea. Tales and stories were still told of those days: of the jolly
monks, of the secluded nuns, some tales good, some bad--just as tales in the
generations to come will be told of the present day. But, whatever scandal may
have been whispered, whatever dark deeds of the dark and rude ages gone by, none
could be raised of the building now. The only inhabited part of it, that
occupied by the good Sisters, who were blameless and self-denying in their
lives, who lived but to do good, was revered by all. <i>That</i> portion of it
was open, and fair, and above-board; but some mysterious notions existed in
regard to the other portion--the Friar's Keep. It was said to be haunted.</p>
<p>Now, this report, attaching to a building of any kind, would be much laughed
at in these later times. For one believer in the superstition (however well it
may be authenticated), ten, ay twenty, would ridicule it. The simple villagers
around believed it religiously: it was said that the Castlemaines, who were
educated gentlemen, and anything but simple, believed it too. The Friar's Keep
was known to be entirely uninhabited, and part of it abandoned to the owls and
bats. This was indisputable; nevertheless, now and again glimpses of a light
would be seen within the rooms by some benighted passer-by, and people were not
wanting to assert that a ghostly form, habited in a friar's light grey cowl and
skirts, would appear at the casement windows, bearing a lamp. Strange noises had
also been heard--or were said to have been. There was not one single inhabitant
of the village, man or woman, who would have dared to cross the chapel ruins and
enter the Friar's Keep alone after nightfall, had it been to save their lives.
It did not lack a foundation, this superstition. Tales were whispered of a
dreadful crime that had been committed by one of the monks: it transpired
abroad; and, to avoid the consequences of being punished by his brethren--who of
course only could punish him after public discovery, whatever they might have
done without it--he had destroyed himself in a certain room, in the grey habit
of his order, and was destined to &quot;come abroad&quot; for ever. So the story ran, and
so it was credited. The good ladies at the Nunnery were grieved and vexed when
allusion was made to the superstition in their presence, and would have put it
down entirely if they could. They did not see anything themselves, were never
disturbed by sounds: but, as the credulous villagers would remark to one another
in private, the Sisters were the very last people who would be likely to see and
hear. They were not near enough to the Friar's Keep for that, and the casements
in the Keep could not be seen from their casements.</p>
<p>The narrow common, or strip of waste land, standing between the street and
the Grey Nunnery is enclosed by somewhat high palings. They run along the entire
length of the building, from end to end, and have two gates of ingress. The one
gate is opposite the porch door of the Grey Nunnery; the other gate leads into
the chapel ruins. It should be mentioned that there was no door or communication
of any kind between the Nunnery and the site of the chapel, and it did not
appear that there ever had been: so that, if anyone required to pass from the
Nunnery to the ruins or to the Friar's Keep, they must go round by the road and
enter in at the other gate. The chapel wall, breast-high still, extended down to
the palings, cutting off the Nunnery and its waste ground from the ruins.</p>
<p>In their secluded home lived these blameless ladies, ever searching for good
to do. In a degree they served to replace the loss of a resident pastor. Many a
sick and dying bed that ought to have been Mr. Marston's care, had they soothed;
more than one frail infant, passing away almost as soon as it had been born, had
Sister Mildred, the pious Superioress, after a few moments spent on her bended
knees in silent deprecatory prayer, taken upon herself to baptize, that it might
be numbered as of the Fold of Christ. They regretted that the clergyman was not
more among them, but there it ended: the clergy of those days were not the
active pastors of these, neither were they expected to be. The Grey Ladies paid
Mr. Marston the utmost respect, and encouraged others to do so; and they were
strict attendants at his irregular services on Sundays.</p>
<p>The origin of the sisterhood was this. Many years before, a Miss Mildred
Grant, being in poor health, had gone to Greylands for change of air. As she
made acquaintance with the fishermen and other poor families, she was quite
struck with their benighted condition, both as to spiritual and temporal need.
She resolved to do what she could to improve this; she thought it might be a
solemn duty laid purposely in her path; and, she took up her abode for good at
one of the cottages, and was joined by her sister, Mary Grant. In course of time
other ladies, wishing to devote their lives to good works joined them; at length
a regular sisterhood of twelve was formed, and they took possession of that
abandoned place, the old Grey Nunnery. Six of these ladies were gentlewomen by
birth and breeding; and these six had brought some portion of means with them.
Six were of inferior degree. These were received without money, and in lieu
thereof made themselves useful, taking it in turns to see to the housekeeping,
to do the domestic work, go on errands, make and mend the clothes, and the like.
All were treated alike, wearing the same dress, and taking their meals
together--save the two who might be on domestic duty for the week. At first the
Sisterhood had attracted much attention and caused some public talk--for such
societies were then almost entirely unknown; but Greylands was a secluded place,
and this soon died away. Sister Mildred remained its head, and she was getting
in years now. She was a clever, practical woman, without having received much
education, though a lady by birth. Latterly she had been in very ill-health; and
she had always laboured under a defect, that of partial deafness. Her sister
Mary had died early.</p>
<p>Immediately beyond the Friar's Keep the rocks rose abruptly again, and the
sight of the sea was there, and for some little way onwards, inaccessible to the
eye. Further on, the heights were tolerably flat, and there the preventive men
were enabled to pace--which they did assiduously: for those were the days of
real smuggling, when fortunes were made by it and sometimes lives marred. The
coastguard had a small station just beyond the village, and the officers looked
pretty sharply after the beach and the doings of the fishermen.</p>
<p>Just opposite the Friar's Keep, on the other side the road, was a lane,
called Chapel Lane, flanking a good-sized clump of trees, almost a grove; and
within these trees rose a small, low, thatched-roof building, styled the Hutt.
The gentleman inhabiting this dwelling, a slight, bronzed, upright, and active
man, with black eyes and black hair, was named Teague. Formerly an officer on
board a man-of-war, he had saved enough for a competency through prize money and
else, and had also a pension. The village called him Commodore: he would have
honestly told you himself that he had no right to that exalted rank--but he did
not in the least object to the appellation. He was a vast favourite with the
village, from the coastguardsmen to the poor fishermen, fond of treating them in
his Hutt, or of giving them a sail in his boat, or a seat in his covered spring
cart--both of which articles he kept for pleasure. In habits he was somewhat
peculiar; living alone without a servant of any kind, male or female, and
waiting entirely on himself.</p>
<p>Chapel Lane--a narrow, pleasant lane, with trees meeting overhead, and wild
flowers adorning its banks and hedges in summer--led into the open country, and
went directly past Greylands' Rest, the residence of the Castlemaines. This lane
was not the chief approach to the house; <i>that</i> was by the high coach-road
that branched off by the Dolphin Inn. And this brings us to speak of the
Castlemaines.</p>
<p>Greylands' Rest, and the estate on which it stood, had been purchased and
entered upon many years before by the then head and chief of the family, Anthony
Castlemaine. His children grew up there. He had three sons--Basil, James, and
Peter. Basil was three or four years the elder, for a little girl had died
between him and James; and if he were living at the present time, he would be
drawing towards sixty years of age. It was not known whether he was living or
not. Anthony Castlemaine had been a harsh and hasty man; and Basil was wild and
wilful. After a good deal of unpleasantness at home, and some bitter quarrelling
between father and son, in which the two younger sons took part against their
brother, Basil quitted his home and went abroad. He was twenty-two then, and had
come into possession of a very fair sum of money, which fell to him from his
late mother. The two other sons came into the same on attaining their majority.
Besides this, Mr. Castlemaine handed over to Basil his portion, so that he went
away rich. He went to seek his fortune and to get rid of his unnatural
relatives, he informed his friends in Greylands and Stilborough, and he hoped
never to come back again until Greylands' Rest was his. He never had come back
all those years, something like five-and-twenty now, and they had never heard
from him directly, though once or twice incidentally. The last time was about
four years ago, when chance news came that he was alive and well.</p>
<p>James Castlemaine had remained with his father at Greylands' Rest, managing
the land on the estate. Peter had taken his portion and set up as a banker at
Stilborough; we have seen with what success. James married, and took his wife
home to Greylands' Rest; but she died soon, leaving him a little son. Several
years subsequently he married again: a widow lady; and she was the present Mrs.
Castlemaine.</p>
<p>Old Anthony Castlemaine lived on, year after year at Greylands' Rest,
wondering whether he should see his eldest son again. With all Basil's faults,
he had been his father's favourite: and the old man grew to long for him. It was
more than either of Basil's brothers did. Basil had had his portion from both
father and mother, and so they washed their hands of him, as the two were wont
to observe, and they did not want him back again. They, at least, had their
wish, though Mr. Castlemaine had not. The old man lived to the age of
eighty-five and then died without seeing his eldest son; without, in fact, being
sure that he was still alive. It was not so very long now since old Anthony
died: they had just put off the mourning for him. James had come into Greylands'
Rest on his father's death: or, at any rate, he had remained in possession; but
of the real facts nothing transpired. Rumours and surmises went abroad freely:
you cannot hinder people's tongues: and very frequently when nothing is known
tongues flow all the faster. Some thought it was left to James In trust for
Basil; but nobody knew, and the Castlemaines were close men, who never talked of
their own affairs. The estate of Greylands' Rest was supposed to be worth about
twelve hundred a year. It was the only portion of old Mr. Castlemaine's property
that there could be any doubt or surmise about: what money he had to dispose of,
he had divided during his lifetime between James and Peter; Basil having had his
at starting. James Castlemaine was the only gentleman of importance living at
Greylands; he was looked up to as a sort of feudal lord by its inhabitants
generally, and swayed them at will.</p>
<p>Following the coach-road that led off by the Dolphin for about half a mile,
you came to a long green avenue on the right hand, which was the chief approach
to Greylands' Rest. It was an old house, built of grey stone; a straggling,
in-and-out, spacious, comfortable mansion, only two stories high. Before the
old-fashioned porch entrance lay a fine green lawn, with seats under its trees,
and beds of flowers. Stables, barns, kitchen gardens, and more lawns and flower
beds lay around. The rooms inside were many, but rather small; and most of them
had to be approached by a narrow passage: as is sometimes the case in ancient
houses that are substantially built. From the upper rooms at the <i>side</i>
of the house could be seen, just opposite, the Friar's Keep, its casements
and its broken upper walls; Commodore Teague's Hutt lying exactly in a line
between the two buildings: and beyond all might be caught glimpses of the
glorious sea.</p>
<p>It was a cold, bright day in February, the day following the dinner at the
banker's. Mr. Castlemaine was busy in his study--a business-room, where he kept
his farming accounts, and wrote his letters--which was on the upper floor of the
house, looking towards the sea and the Friar's Keep, and was approached from the
wide corridor by a short narrow passage having a door at either end. The inner
door Mr. Castlemaine often kept locked. In a pretty room below, warm and
comfortable, and called the Red Parlour from its prevailing colour, its ceiling
low, its windows opening to the lawn, but closed to-day, sat the ladies of his
family: Mrs. Castlemaine, her daughter Flora, and Ethel Reene.</p>
<p>It has been said that James Castlemaine's second wife was a widow--she was a
Mrs. Reene. Her first marriage had also been to a widower, Mr. Reene, who had
one daughter, Ethel. Mrs. Reene never took to this stepchild; she was jealous of
Mr. Reene's affection for her; and when, on Mr. Reene's death, which occurred
shortly after the marriage, it was found that he had left considerably more
money to his child than to his new wife, Mrs. Reene's dislike was complete. A
year or two after her marriage with Mr. Castlemaine, a little girl was born to
her--Flora. On this child, her only one, she lavished all her love--but she had
none for Ethel. Mr. Castlemaine, on his part, gave the greater portion of his
affection to his son, the child of his first wife, Harry. A very fine young man
now, of some five-and-twenty years, was Harry Castlemaine, and his father was
wrapped up in him. Ethel addressed Mr. and Mrs. Castlemaine as &quot;papa&quot; and
&quot;mamma,&quot; but she was in point of fact not really related to either. She was five
years old when she came to Greylands' Rest, had grown up there as a child of the
house, and often got called, out of doors, &quot;Miss Castlemaine.&quot;</p>
<p>Ethel seemed to stand alone without kith or kin, with no one to love her; and
she felt it keenly. As much as a young lady can be put upon and snubbed in a
gentleman's well-appointed family, Ethel Reene was. Mr. Castlemaine was always
kind to her, though perhaps somewhat indifferent; Mrs. Castlemaine was unkind
and tyrannical; Flora--an indulged, selfish, ill-bred girl of twelve, forward
enough in some things for one double her age--did her best to annoy her in all
ways. And Mrs. Castlemaine permitted this: she could see no fault in Flora, she
hated Ethel. Ethel Reene was nineteen now, growing fast into womanhood; but she
was young for her years, and of a charming simplicity--not so rare in girls then
as it is now. She was good, gentle, and beautiful; with a pale, quiet beauty
that slowly takes hold of the heart, but as surely stays there. Her large eyes,
full of depth, sweetness, and feeling, gazed out at you with almost the
straightforward innocence of a child: and no child's heart could have been more
free from guile. Her hair was dark, her pretty features were refined and
delicate, her whole appearance ladylike and most attractive.</p>
<p>Ethel Reene had much to put up with in her everyday life: for Mrs.
Castlemaine's conduct was trying in the extreme; Flora's worse than trying. She
seldom retaliated: having learnt how useless retaliation from <i>her</i> was
against them: and, besides, she loved peace. But she was not without spirit: and
only herself knew what it had cost her to learn to keep that spirit under:
sometimes when matters went too far, she would check her stepmother's angry
torrent by a few firm words, and quietly leave the room to take refuge in the
peace and solitude of her own chamber. Or else she would put her bonnet on and
wander away to the cliffs; where, seated on the extreme edge, she would remain
for hours, looking out on the sea. She had once been fond of taking her place in
the chapel ruins, and sitting there, for the expanse of ocean seen from thence
was most grand and beautiful; sometimes, when the water was low, so that the
strip of beach beneath could be gained, she would step down the short but
dangerous rock to it--which strip of beach was only accessible from the chapel
ruins and at low tide. But one day Mr. Castlemaine happened to see her do this;
he was very angry, and absolutely forbade her, not only to descend the rocks,
but to enter, under any pretence whatsoever, the site of the chapel ruins. Ethel
was not one to disobey.</p>
<p>But to sit on the higher rocks farther up, by the coastguard station, was not
denied her; Mr. Castlemaine only enjoining her to be cautious. It had grown to
be her favourite spot, and she often sat or walked there on the cliff's edge.
The ever-changing water seemed to bring consolation to her spirit; it spoke to
her in strange, soothing whispers; it fed the romance and the dreams that lie in
a young girl's heart. When the sea was rough and the waves dashed against the
cliffs, flinging up their spray mountains high, and sprinkling her face as with
a mist, she would stand, lost in the grandeur and awe of the scene, her hat off
and held by its ribbons, her hair floating in the wind: the sky and the waves
seemed to speak to her soul of immortality; to bring nearer to her the far-off
gates of heaven. And so, for want of suitable companionship, Ethel Reene shared
her secrets with the sea.</p>
<p>The glass doors of the red parlour were closed to-day against the east wind;
the lawn beyond, though bright with sunshine, lay cold under its bare and wintry
trees. Mrs. Castlemaine sat by the fire working at a pair of slippers; a little
woman, she, dressed in striped green silk, with light hair, and a cross look on
what had once been a very pretty, though sharp-featured face. Ethel sat near the
window, drawing; she wore a bright ruby winter dress of fine merino, with some
white lace at its throat and sleeves; a blue ribbon, to which was suspended some
small gold ornament, encircled her delicate neck; drops of gold were in her
ears; and her pretty cheeks were flushed to crimson, for Mrs. Castlemaine was
hot in dispute and making her feel very angry. Flora, a restless damsel, in a
flounced brown frock and white pinafore, with a fair, pretty, saucy face, and
her flaxen curls tied back with blue, was perched on the music-stool before
Ethel's piano, striking barbarous chords with one hand and abusing Ethel
alternately.</p>
<p>The dispute to-day was this. Miss Oldham, Flora's governess, had lately given
warning precipitately, and left Greylands' Rest; tired out, as everybody but
Mrs. Castlemaine knew, with her pupil's insolence. Mrs. Castlemaine had not yet
found anyone willing, or whom she deemed eligible, to replace her--for it must
be remembered that governesses then were somewhat rare. Weary of waiting, Mrs.
Castlemaine had come to a sudden determination, and was now announcing it, that
Ethel should have the honour of filling the post.</p>
<p>&quot;It is of no use, mamma,&quot; said Ethel. &quot;I could not teach; I am sure I am not
fit for it. And, you know, Flora would never obey <i>me</i>.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That I'd not,&quot; put in Miss Flora, wheeling herself half round on the stool.
&quot;I hate governesses; and they do me no good. I don't know half as much as I did
when Miss Oldham came, twelve months ago. Do I, mamma?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I fear you do not, my darling,&quot; replied Mrs. Castlemaine. &quot;Miss Oldham's
system of teaching was quite a failure, and she sadly neglected her duty;
but----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, mamma,&quot; interrupted Flora, peevishly, &quot;don't put in that horrid 'but.' I
tell you I hate governesses; I'm not going to have another. Nothing but learning
lessons, lessons, lessons, all day long, just as though you wanted <i>me</i> to
be a governess!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you did not learn, Flora, you would grow up a little heathen,&quot; Ethel
ventured to remark. &quot;You would not like that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now don't you put in your word,&quot; retorted the girl, passionately. &quot;It's not
your place to interfere with me: is it, mamma?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly not, my sweet child.&quot;</p>
<p>Miss Flora had changed her place. Quitting the music-stool for the hearthrug,
she took up the poker; and now stood brandishing it around, and looking daggers
at Ethel. Ethel, her sweet face still flushed, went steadily on with her
drawing.</p>
<p>&quot;She's as ill-natured as she can be! She'd like--mamma, she'd like--to see me
toiling at geography and French grammar all night as well as all day. Nasty
thing!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can believe anything of Ethel that is ill-natured,&quot; equably spoke Mrs.
Castlemaine, turning her slipper. &quot;But I have made up my mind that she shall
teach you, Flo, my love, under--of course, entirely under--my superintendence.
Miss Oldham used to resent interference.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I do think, mamma, you must be joking!&quot; cried Ethel, turning her flushed
face and her beautiful eyes on her stepmother.</p>
<p>&quot;When do I joke?&quot; retorted Mrs. Castlemaine. &quot;It will save the nuisance of a
governess in the house: <i>and you shall teach Flora</i>.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll give her all the trouble I can; she's a toad,&quot; cried Miss Flora,
bringing the poker within an inch of her mother's nose. &quot;And I'll learn just
what I like, and let alone what I don't like. <i>She's</i> not going to be set
up in authority over me, as Miss Oldham was. I'll kick you if you try it,
Ethel.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stop, stop,&quot; spoke Ethel, firmness in her tone, decision on her pretty lips.
&quot;Mamma, pray understand me; I cannot attempt to do this. My life is not very
pleasant now; it would be unbearable then. You know--you see--what Flora is: how
can you ask me?&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Castlemaine half rose, in her angry spirit. It was something new for
Ethel to set her mandates at defiance. Her voice turned to a scream; her small
light eyes dilated.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you beard me in my own house, Ethel Reene? I say that you <i>shall</i>
do this. I am mistress here----&quot;</p>
<p>Mistress she might be, but Mr. Castlemaine was master and at that moment the
door opened, and he came in. Disputes were not very unusual in his home, but
this seemed to be a frantic one.</p>
<p>&quot;What is the meaning of this?&quot; he inquired, halting in astonishment, and
taking in the scene with his keen dark eyes. His wife unusually angry, her voice
high; Ethel in tears--for they had come unbidden; Flora brandishing the poker
towards Ethel, and dancing to its movements.</p>
<p>Mrs. Castlemaine sat down to resume her wool-work, her ruffled feathers
subdued to smoothness. She never cared to give way to unseemly temper, no, nor
to injustice, in the presence of her husband; for she had the grace to feel that
he would be ashamed of it--ashamed for her; and that it would still further
weaken the little influence she retained over him.</p>
<p>&quot;Were you speaking of a governess for Flora?&quot; he asked, advancing and taking
the poker from the young lady's hand. &quot;What has Ethel to do with that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was observing that Ethel has a vast deal of leisure time, and that she
might, rather than be idle, fill it up by teaching Flora,&quot; replied Mrs.
Castlemaine, as softly as though her mouth were made of butter. &quot;Especially as
Ethel's French is so perfect. As a temporary thing, of course, if--if it did not
answer.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I do not find Ethel idle: she always seems to me to have some occupation on
hand,&quot; observed Mr. Castlemaine. &quot;As to her undertaking the teaching of
Flora--would you like it, Ethel?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, papa,&quot; was the brave answer, as she strove to hide her tears. &quot;I have, I
am sure, no talent for teaching; I dislike it very much: and Flora would never
obey a word I said. It would make my life miserable--I was saying so when you
came in.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then, my dear child, the task shall certainly not be put upon yon. Why need
you have feared it would be? We have no more right to force Ethel to do what is
distasteful to her, than we should have to force it on ourselves,&quot; he added,
turning to his wife. &quot;You must see that, Sophia.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But----&quot; began Mrs. Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;No buts, as to this,&quot; he interrupted. &quot;You are well able to pay and keep a
governess--and, as Ethel justly observes, she would not be able to do anything
with Flora. Miss Oldham could not do it. My opinion is, no governess ever will
do it, so long as you spoil the child.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't spoil her, James.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Castlemaine lifted his dark eyebrows: the assertion was too palpably
untrue to be worthy a refutation. &quot;The better plan to adopt with Flora would be
to send her to school, as Harry says----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That I will never do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then look out for a successor to Miss Oldham. And, my strong advice to you,
Sophia, is--let the governess, when she comes, hold entire control over Flora
and be allowed to punish her when she deserves it. I shall not care to see her
grow up the self-willed, unlovable child she seems to be now.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Castlemaine folded up her slipper quietly and left the room; she was
boiling over with rage, in spite of her apparent calmness. Flora, who stood in
fear of her father, flew off to the kitchen, to demand bread and jam and worry
the servants. Ethel was going on with her drawing; and Mr. Castlemaine, who had
a taste for sketching himself, went and looked over her.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, papa,&quot; she softly said, lifting to him for a moment her loving
eyes. &quot;It would have been bad both for Flora and for me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course it would,&quot; he replied: &quot;Flora ought to have a good tight rein over
her. What's this you are doing, Ethel? The Friar's Keep! Why, what a curious
coincidence! Mary Ursula was filling in just the same thing last night.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Was she, papa? It makes a nice sketch.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You don't draw as well as Mary Ursula does, Ethel.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I do nothing as well as she does, papa. I don't think anybody does.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What are those figures in the foreground?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I meant them for two of the Grey Sisters. Their cloaks are not finished
yet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said Mr. Castlemaine, rather shortly. &quot;And that's a group of fishermen,
I see: much the more sensible people of the two.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What did Mary Ursula say last night, papa?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Say? Nothing particular. She sent her love to Ethel.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did she dine at table?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, of course not, child. Miss Mountsorrel spent the evening with her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And, papa,&quot; whispered Ethel, with a pretty little laugh and blush, &quot;is it
fixed yet?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is what fixed?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The wedding-day.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think so--or you would have heard of it. I expect she will ask you
to be her bridesmaid.&quot;</p>

<h4><a name="div1_03" href="#div1Ref_03">CHAPTER III.</a></h4>
<h5>AT THE DOLPHIN INN.</h5>
<br>

<p>The Dolphin Inn, as already said, stood in the angle between the village
street and the high road that branched off from the street to the open country.
It faced the road, standing, like most of the dwellings in Greylands, somewhat
back from it. A substantial, low-roofed house, painted yellow, with a flaming
sign-board in front, bearing a dolphin with various hues and colours, and two low
bow-windows on either side the door. Beyond lay a yard with out-houses and
stables, and there was some good land behind. Along the wall, underneath the
parlour windows and on either side of the entrance door, ran a bench on which
wayfarers might sit; at right angles with it, near the yard, was a pump with a
horse-trough beside it. Upon a pinch, the inn could supply a pair of
post-horses: but they were seldom called for, as Stilborough was so near. It was
the only inn of any kind at Greylands, and was frequented by the fishermen, as
well as occasionally by more important guests. The landlord was John Bent. The
place was his own, and had been his father's before him. He was considered to be
a &quot;warm&quot; man; to be able to live at his ease, irrespective of custom. John Bent
was independent in manner and speech, except to his wife. Mrs. Bent, a thrifty,
bustling, talkative woman, had taken John's independence out of him at first
setting off, so far as she was concerned; but they got on very well together. To
Mr. Castlemaine especially John was given to show independence. They were civil
to each other, but there was no love lost between them. Mr. Castlemaine would
have liked to purchase the Dolphin and the land pertaining to it: he had made
more than one strong overture to do so, which John had resisted and resented.
The landlord, too, had taken up an idea that Mr. Castlemaine did not encourage
the sojourn of strangers at the inn; but had done his best in a quiet way to
discourage it, as was observed in regard to the Grey Ladies. Altogether John
Bent did not favour the Master of Greylands.</p>
<p>On one of the days of this selfsame month of February, when the air was keen
and frosty and the sea sparkled under the afternoon sunshine, John Bent and his
wife sat in the room they mostly occupied, which was called the best kitchen.
Called so in familiar parlance only, however, for it was really used as the
sitting-room of the landlord and his wife, and not for cooking. The room was on
the side of the house, its large, low, three-framed window and its door facing
the beach. Outside this window was another of those hospitable benches, for
customers to sit down on to drink their ale when it pleased them. Mrs. Bent
herself liked to sit there when work was over, and criticise the doings of the
village. Whatever might be the weather, this door, like the front one, stood
open; and well-known guests, or neighbours stepping in for a gossip, would enter
by it. But no customer attempted to call for pipe or drink in the room, unless
specially permitted.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bent stood at the table before the window, picking shrimps for potting.
She was slim and active, with dark curls on either side of her thin and comely
face. Her cap had cherry-coloured ribbons in it, her favourite colour, and
flying strings; her cotton gown, of a chintz pattern, was drawn through its
pocket-hole, displaying a dark stuff petticoat, and neat shoes and stockings.
John Bent sat at the blazing fire, as near to it as he could get his wooden
chair in, reading the &quot;Stilborough Herald.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's uncommon cold to-day!&quot; he broke out presently, giving a twist to his
back. &quot;The wind comes in and cuts one like a knife. Don't you think, Dorothy, we
might shut that door a bit these sharp days?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, I don't,&quot; said Mrs. Bent.</p>
<p>&quot;You'll get rheumatism yet before the winter's over, as sure as you're a
living woman. Or I shall.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Shall I?&quot; retorted Mrs. Bent, in her sharply decisive tones. &quot;Over forty
years of age I am now, and I've been here nigh upon twenty, and never had a
touch of it yet. I am not going to begin to shut up doors and windows, John
Bent, to please you or anybody else.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus put down, John resigned himself to his paper again. He was a spare,
middle-sized man, some few years older than his wife, with a red healthy face
and scanty grey hair. Presently he laid the newspaper aside, and sat watching
his wife's nimble fingers.</p>
<p>&quot;Dorothy, woman, when those shrimps are done, you might send a pot of 'em
over to poor Sister Mildred. She's uncommon weak, they say.&quot;</p>
<p>The very idea that had been running through Mrs. Bent's own mind. But she did
not receive the suggestion courteously.</p>
<p>&quot;Suppose you attend to your own concerns, John. If I am to supply the parish
with shrimps gratis, it's about time I left off potting.&quot;</p>
<p>John picked up his paper again with composure: he was accustomed to all this:
and just then a shadow fell across the room. A fisherman was standing at the
open door with some fish for sale.</p>
<p>&quot;It's you, Tim, is it?&quot; cried Mrs. Bent, in her shrillest tones. &quot;It's not
often your <i>lazy</i> limbs bring me anything worth buying. What is it to-day?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A splendid cod, Mrs. Bent,&quot; replied the man. &quot;Never was finer caught.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And a fine price, I dare be bound!&quot; returned the landlady, stepping aside to
inspect the fish. &quot;What's the price?&quot;</p>
<p>Tim named it; putting on a little to allow of what he knew would ensue--the
beating down. Mrs. Bent spoke loudly in her wrath.</p>
<p>&quot;Now look here, Tim Gleeson!--do you think I'm made of money; or do you think
I'm soft? I'll give you just half the sum. If you don't like it you may take
yourself off and your fish behind you.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Bent got the cod at her price. She had returned to her shrimps, when,
after a gentle tap at the open door, there entered one of the Grey Sisters.
Sister Ann--whose week it was to help in the domestic work and to go on
errands--was a busy, cheerful, sensible woman, as fond of talking as Mrs. Bent
herself. She was dressed entirely in grey. A grey stuff gown of a convenient
length for walking, that is, just touching the ankles; a grey cloth cloak
reaching down nearly as far; and a round grey straw bonnet with a white net
border close to the face. When the ladies took possession of the Grey Nunnery,
and constituted themselves a Sisterhood, they had assumed this attire. It was
neat, suitable, and becoming; and not of a nature to attract particular
attention when only one or two of them were seen abroad together. From the
dress, however, had arisen the appellation applied to them--the Grey Ladies. In
summer weather the stuff used was of a lighter texture. The stockings worn by
Sister Ann were grey, the shoes stout, and fastened with a steel buckle. The
only difference made by the superior sisters was, that the material of their
gowns and cloaks was finer and softer, and their stockings were white.</p>
<p>&quot;Lack-a-day! these shrimps will never get done!&quot; cried Mrs. Bent, under her
breath. &quot;How d'ye do, Sister Ann?&quot; she said aloud, her tones less sharp, out of
respect to the Order. &quot;You look as blue as bad news. I hope there's no fresh
sickness or accident.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's the east wind,&quot; replied Sister Ann. &quot;Coming round that beach corner, it
does seize hold of one. I've such a pain here with it,&quot; touching her chest,
&quot;that I can hardly draw my breath.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Cramps,&quot; said Mrs. Bent, shortly. &quot;John,&quot; she added, turning sharply on her
husband, &quot;you'd better get Sister Ann a spoonful or two of that cordial, instead
of sitting to roast your face at that fire till it's the colour of red pepper.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not for worlds,&quot; interposed Sister Ann, really meaning it. But John, at the
hospitable suggestion, had moved away.</p>
<p>&quot;I have come over to ask you if you'll be good enough to let me have a small
pot of currant jelly, Mrs. Bent,&quot; continued the Grey Sister. &quot;It is for Sister
Mildred, poor thing----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is she no better?&quot; interrupted Mrs. Bent.</p>
<p>&quot;Not a bit. And her lips are so parched, poor lady, and her deafness is so
worrying----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, as to her deafness, <i>that</i>'ll never be better,&quot; cried Mrs. Bent.
&quot;It will get worse as she grows older.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It can't be much worse than it is: it has always been bad,&quot; returned Sister
Ann, who seemed slightly to resent the fact of the deafness. &quot;We have had a good
bit of sickness in the village, and our black currant jelly is all gone: not
that we made much, being so poor. If you will let me buy a pot from you, Mrs.
Bent, we shall be glad.&quot;</p>
<p>For answer, Mrs. Bent left her shrimps, unlocked a corner cupboard, and put
two small pots of jelly into the Sister's hand.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not sure that I can afford both to-day,&quot; said Sister Ann, dubiously.
&quot;How much are they?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing,&quot; returned Mrs. Bent. &quot;Not one farthing will I take from the ladies:
I'm always glad to do the little I can for any of you. Give them to Sister
Mildred with my respects; and say, please, that when I've done my shrimps I'll
bring her over a pot of them. I was intending to do it before you came in.&quot;</p>
<p>The landlord returned with something in a wine-glass, and stopped the
Sister's thanks by making her drink it. Putting the jelly in her basket, Sister
Ann, who had no time to stay for a longer gossip that day, gratefully departed.</p>
<p>&quot;It's well the Master of Greylands didn't hear you promise the shrimps and
give her them two pots of jelly, wife,&quot; cried John Bent, with a queer kind of
laugh. &quot;He'd not have liked it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Master of Greylands may lump it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's my belief he'd like to drive the Grey Sisters away from the place,
instead of having 'em helped with pots of jelly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What I choose to do, I <i>do</i> do, thank goodness, without need to ask
leave of anybody,&quot; returned independent Mrs. Bent.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't think what it is puts Mr. Castlemaine against 'em,&quot; debated John
Bent, thoughtfully. &quot;Unless he fancies that if they were less busy over
religion, and that, we might get the parson here more as a regular thing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We should be none the better for him,&quot; snapped Mrs. Bent. &quot;For my part, I
don't see much good in parsons,&quot; she candidly added. &quot;They only get into
people's way.&quot;</p>
<p>The silence that ensued was broken by a sound of horses in the distance,
followed by the blowing of a horn. John Bent and his wife looked simultaneously
at the eight-day clock, ticking in its mahogany case by the fire, and saw that
it was on the stroke of four, which was the time the London coach came by. John
passed through the house to the front door; his wife, after glancing at herself
in the hanging glass and giving a twitch to her cap and her cherry ribbons, left
her shrimps and followed him.</p>
<p>It was not that they expected the coach to bring visitors to them. Passengers
from London and elsewhere were generally bound to Stilborough. But they as
regularly went to the door to be in readiness, in case any did alight; to see it
pass, and to exchange salutations with the coachman and guard.</p>
<p>It was an event in the Dolphin's somewhat monotonous day's existence.</p>
<p>&quot;I do believe, wife, it's going to stop!&quot; cried John.</p>
<p>It was doing that already. The four horses were drawing up; the guard was
descending from his seat behind. He opened the door to let out a gentleman, and
took a portmanteau from the boot. Before John Bent, naturally slow of movement,
had well bestirred himself, the gentleman, who seemed to be remarkably quick and
active, had put some money into the guard's hand and caught up his portmanteau.</p>
<p>&quot;I beg your pardon, sir,&quot; said John, taking it from him. &quot;You are welcome,
sir: will you be pleased to enter?&quot;</p>
<p>The stranger was on the point of stepping indoors, when he halted and looked
up at the signboard--at the dolphin depicted there in all the hues of the
rainbow, its tail lashing up spouts of imaginary water. Smiling to himself,
almost as though the dolphin were an old acquaintance, he went in. Mrs. Bent
courtesied low to him in the good old respectful fashion, and he returned it
with a bow.</p>
<p>A fire was blazing in one of the parlours, and to this room the guest was
conducted by both landlord and landlady. Taking off his upper coat, which was
warmly slashed with dark Fur, they saw a slight, active man of some
eight-and-twenty years, under the middle height, with a fresh, pleasant,
handsome face, and bright dark eyes. Something in the face seemed to strike on a
chord of the landlord's memory.</p>
<p>&quot;Who the dickens is he like?&quot; mentally questioned John. &quot;Anyway, I like his
looks.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can have a bedchamber, I suppose?&quot; spoke the stranger; and they noticed
that his English, though quite fluent as to words, had a foreign ring in it.
&quot;Will you show me to one?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;At your service, sir; please step this way,&quot; said Mrs. Bent, in her most
gracious tones, for she was habitually courteous to her guests, and was besides
favourably impressed by this one's looks and manners. &quot;Hot water directly,
Molly,&quot; she called out in the direction of the kitchen; &quot;and John, do you bring
up the gentleman's luggage.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can't think who it is his face puts me in mind of,&quot; began John, when he
and his wife got back to their room again, and she set on to make hasty work of
the shrimps.</p>
<p>&quot;Rubbish to his face,&quot; spoke Mrs. Bent. &quot;The face is nice enough, if you mean
that. It's late to get anything of a dinner up; and he has not said what he'll
have, though I asked him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And look here, wife--that portmanteau is not an English one.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It may be Dutch, for all it matters to us. Now John Bent, just you stir up
that fire a bit, and put some coal on. I may have to bring a saucepan in here,
for what I know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tush!&quot; said John, doing as he was bid, nevertheless. &quot;A chop and a potato:
that's as much as most of these chance travellers want.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not when they are from over the water. I don't forget the last foreign
Frenchman that put up here. Fifteen dishes he wanted for his dinner, if he
wanted one. And all of 'em dabs and messes.&quot;</p>
<p>She had gone to carry away her shrimps when the stranger came down. He walked
direct into the room, and looked from the open door. The landlord stood up.</p>
<p>&quot;You are Thomas Bent, I think,&quot; said the stranger, turning round.</p>
<p>&quot;John Bent, sir. My father was Thomas Bent, and he has been dead many a
year.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And this is your good wife?&quot; he added, as the landlady came bustling in.
&quot;Mistress of the inn.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And master too,&quot; muttered John, in an undertone.</p>
<p>&quot;I was about to order dinner, Mr. Bent----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then you'd better order it of me, sir,&quot; put in the landlady. &quot;His head's no
better than a sieve if it has much to carry. Ask for spinach and cauliflower,
and you'd get served up carrots and turnips.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then I cannot do better than leave my dinner to you, madam,&quot; said the young
man with a pleasant laugh. &quot;I should like some fish out of that glorious sea;
and the rest I leave to you. Can I have an English plum-pudding?</p>
<p>&quot;An English plum-pudding! Good gracious, sir, it could not be made and
boiled!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That will do for to-morrow, then.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Bent departed, calling to Molly as she went. The inn kept but two
servants; Molly, and a man; the latter chiefly attending to out-of-door things:
horses, pigs and such like. When further help was needed indoors, it could be
had from the village.</p>
<p>&quot;This must be a healthy spot,&quot; remarked the stranger, taking a chair without
ceremony at John Bent's fire. &quot;It is very open.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uncommon healthy, sir. A bit bleak in winter, when the wind's in the east;
as it is to-day.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Have you many good families residing about?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Only one, sir. The Castlemaines?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Castlemaines?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An old family who have lived here for many a year. You'd pass their place,
sir, not long before getting out here; a house of greystone on your left hand.
It is called Greylands' Rest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have heard of Greylands' Rest--and also of the Castlemaines. It belonged,
I think, to old Anthony Castlemaine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It did, sir. His son has it now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I fancied he had more than one son.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He had three, sir. The eldest, Mr. Basil, went abroad and never was heard of
after: leastways, nothing direct from him. The second, Mr. James, has Greylands'
Rest. He always lived there with his father, and he lives there still--master of
all since the old gentleman died.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How did it come to him?&quot; asked the stranger, hastily. &quot;By will?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, sir, that's what no soul can tell. All sorts of surmises went about; but
nobody knows how it was.&quot;</p>
<p>A pause. &quot;And the third son? Where is he?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The third's Mr. Peter. He is a banker at Stilborough.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is he rich?&quot;</p>
<p>John Bent laughed at the question. &quot;Rich, sir? Him? Why, it's said he could
almost buy up the world. He has one daughter; a beautiful young lady, who's
going to be married to young Mr. Blake-Gordon, a son of Sir Richard. Many
thought that Mr. Castlemaine--the present Master of Greylands--would have liked
to get her for his own son. But----&quot;</p>
<p>In burst Mrs. Bent, a big cooking apron tied on over her gown. She looked
slightly surprised at seeing the stranger-seated there; but said nothing.
Unlocking the corner cupboard, and throwing wide its doors, she began searching
for something on the shelves.</p>
<p>&quot;Here you are, Mrs. Bent! Busy as usual.&quot;</p>
<p>The sudden salutation came from a gentleman who had entered the house
hastily. A tall, well-made, handsome, young fellow, with a ready tongue, and a
frank expression in his dark brown eyes. He stood just inside the door, and did
not observe the stranger.</p>
<p>&quot;Is it you, Mr. Harry?&quot; she said, glancing round.</p>
<p>&quot;It's nobody else,&quot; he answered. &quot;What an array of jam pots! Do you leave the
key in the door? A few of those might be walked off and never be missed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I should like to see anybody attempt it,&quot; cried Mrs. Bent, wrathfully. &quot;You
are always joking, Mr. Harry.&quot;</p>
<p>He laughed cordially. &quot;John,&quot; he said, turning to the landlord, &quot;did the
coach bring a parcel for me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, sir. Were you expecting one, Mr. Harry?&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Bent turned completely round from her cupboard. &quot;It's not a trick you
are thinking to play us, is it, sir? <i>I</i> have not forgotten that other
parcel you had left here once.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Other parcel? Oh, that was ever so many years ago. I am expecting this from
London, John, if you will take it in. It will come to-morrow, I suppose. Mrs.
Bent thinks I am a boy still.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah no, sir, that I don't,&quot; she said. &quot;You've long grown beyond that, and out
of my control.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Out of everybody else's too,&quot; he laughed. &quot;Where I used to get cuffs I now
get kisses, Mrs. Bent. And I am not sure but they are the more dangerous
application of the two.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<i>I</i> am very sure they are,&quot; called out Mrs. Bent, as the young man went
off laughing, after bowing slightly to the stranger, who was now standing up,
and whose appearance bespoke him to be a gentleman.</p>
<p>&quot;Who was that?&quot; asked the stranger of John Bent.</p>
<p>&quot;That was Mr. Harry Castlemaine, sir. Son of the Master of Greylands.&quot;</p>
<p>With one leap, the stranger was outside the door, gazing after him. But Harry
Castlemaine, quick and active, was already nearly beyond view. When the stranger
came back to his place again, Mrs. Bent had locked up her cupboard and was gone.</p>
<p>&quot;A fine-looking young man,&quot; he remarked.</p>
<p>&quot;And a good-hearted one as ever lived--though he is a bit random,&quot; said John.
&quot;I like Mr. Harry; I don't like his father.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why not?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, sir, I hardly know why. One is apt to take dislikes sometimes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You were speaking of Greylands' Rest--of the rumours that went abroad
respecting it when old Mr. Castlemaine died. What were they?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Various rumours, sir; but all tending to one and the same point. And that
was, whether Greylands' Rest had, or had not, legally come to Mr. James
Castlemaine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Being the second son,&quot; quietly spoke the stranger. &quot;There can be no question
I should think, that the rightful heir was the eldest son, Basil.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And it was known, too, that Basil was his father's favourite; and that the
old man during his last years was always looking and longing for him to come
back,&quot; spoke John Bent, warming with the subject: &quot;and in short, sir, everybody
expected it would be left to Basil. On the other hand, James was close at hand,
and the old man could leave it to him if he pleased.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;One glance at the will would set all doubt at rest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ay. But it was not known, sir, whether there was a will, or not.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not known?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, sir. Some said there was a will, and that it left all to Mr. Basil;
others said there was no will at all, but that old Anthony Castlemaine made Mr.
James a deed of gift of Greylands' Rest. And a great many said, and still say,
that old Mr. Castlemaine only handed him over the estate <i>in trust</i> for Mr.
Basil--or for any sons Mr. Basil might leave after him.&quot;</p>
<p>The stranger sat in silence. On his little finger shone a magnificent diamond
ring, evidently of great value; he twirled it about unconsciously.</p>
<p>&quot;What is <i>your</i> opinion, Mr. Bent?&quot; he suddenly asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Mine, sir? Well, I can't help thinking that the whole was left to Mr. Basil,
and that if he's alive the place is no more Mr. James's than it is mine. I think
it particularly for two reasons: one because the old man always said it would be
Basil's; and again if it was given to Mr. James, whether by will or by deed of
gift, he would have taken care to <i>show</i> abroad the will or the deed that
gave it him, and so set the rumours at rest for good. Not but what all the
Castlemaines are close and haughty-natured men, never choosing to volunteer
information about themselves. So that----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now then, John Bent! It's about time you began to lay the cloth and see to
the silver.&quot;</p>
<p>No need to say from whom the interruption came. Mrs. Bent, her face flushed
to the colour of the cherry ribbons, whisked in and whisked out again. John
followed; and set about his cloth-laying. The stranger sat where he was, in a
reverie, until called to dinner.</p>
<p>It was a small, but most excellent repast, the wine taken with it some of the
Dolphin's choice Burgundy, of which it had a little bin. John Bent waited on his
guest, who dined to his complete satisfaction. He was about to leave the bottle
on the table after dinner, but the guest motioned it away.</p>
<p>&quot;No, no more; I do not drink after dinner. It is not our custom in France.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, very well, sir. I'll cork it up for to-morrow. I--I beg your pardon,
sir,&quot; resumed the landlord, as he drew the cloth from the table, &quot;what name
shall I put down to you, sir?&quot;</p>
<p>The stranger rose and stood on the hearthrug, speaking distinctly when he
gave his name.</p>
<p>Speaking distinctly. Nevertheless John Bent seemed not to hear it, for he
stared like one in a dream.</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; he gasped, in a startled tone of terror, as he staggered back against
the sideboard; and some of the fresh colour left his face. &quot;<i>What</i> name did
you say, sir?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Anthony Castlemaine.&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h4><a name="div1_04" href="#div1Ref_04">CHAPTER IV.</a></h4>
<h5>FORESHADOWINGS OF EVIL.</h5>
<br>

<p>The stone walls of Greylands' Rest lay cold and still under the pale sunshine
of the February day. The air was sharp and frosty; the sun, though bright to the
eye, had little warmth in it; and the same cutting east wind that John Bent had
complained of to the traveller who had alighted at his house the previous
afternoon, was prevailing still with an equal keenness.</p>
<p>Mr. Castlemaine felt it in his study, where he had been busy all the morning.
He fancied he must have caught a chill, for a slight shiver suddenly stirred his
tall, fine frame, and he turned to the fire and gave it a vigorous poke. The
fuel was wood and coal mixed, and the blaze went roaring up the chimney. The
room was not large. Standing with his back to the fire, the window was on his
right hand; the door on his left; opposite to him, against the wall, stood a
massive piece of mahogany furniture, called a bureau. It was a kind of closed-in
desk, made somewhat in the fashion of the banker's desk at Stilborough, but
larger; the inside had pigeon-holes and deep drawers, and a slab for writing on.
This inside was well filled with neatly arranged bundles of papers, with account
books belonging to the farm business and else, and with some few old letters:
and the Master of Greylands was as cautions to keep this desk closed and locked
from the possibility of the view of those about him as his brother Peter was to
keep his. The Castlemaines were proud, reticent, and careful men.</p>
<p>For a good part of the morning Mr. Castlemaine had been busy at this desk. He
had shut and locked it now, and was standing with his back to the fire, deep in
thought. Two letters of the large size in vogue before envelopes were used, and
sealed with the Castlemaine crest in red wax, lay on the side-table, ready to be
posted. His left hand was inside his waistcoat, resting on the broad plaited
shirt-frill of fine cambric; his bright dark eyes had rather a troubled look in
them as they sought that old building over the fields opposite, the Friar's
Keep, and the sparkling sea beyond. In reality, Mr. Castlemaine was looking
neither at the Friar's Keep nor the sea, for he was deep in thought and saw
nothing.</p>
<p>The Master of Greylands was of a superstitious nature: it may as well be
stated candidly: difficult though it was to believe such of so practical a man.
Not to the extent of giving credit to stories of ghosts and apparitions; the
probability is, that in his heart he would have laughed at that; but he did
believe in signs and warnings, in omens of ill-luck and good luck.</p>
<p>On this selfsame morning he had awoke with an impression of discomfort, as if
some impending evil were hanging over him; he could not account for it, for
there was no conducing cause; and at the time he did not connect it with any
superstitions feeling or fancy, but thought he must be either out of sorts, or
had had some annoyance that he did not at the moment of waking recollect;
something lying latent in his mind. Three or four little hindrances, or mishaps,
occurred when he was dressing. First of all, he could not find his slippers: he
hunted here; he looked there; and then remembered that he had left them the
previous night in his study--a most unusual thing for him to do--and he had to
go and fetch them, or else dress in his stockings. Next, in putting on his
shirt, he tore the buttonhole at the neck, and was obliged to change it for
another. And the last thing he did was to upset all his shaving water, and had
to wait while fresh was brought.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing but impediments: it seems as though I were not to get dressed
to-day,&quot; muttered the Master of Greylands. &quot;Can there be any ill-luck in store
for me?&quot;</p>
<p>The intelligent reader will doubtless be much surprised to hear him ask so
ridiculous a question. Nevertheless, the same kind of thing--these marked
hindrances--had occurred twice before in Mr. Castlemaine's life, and each time a
great evil had followed in the day. Not of the present time was he thinking, now
as he stood, but of one of those past days, and of what it had brought forth.</p>
<p>&quot;Poor Maria!&quot; he softly cried--alluding to his first wife, of whom he had
been passionately fond. &quot;Well, and merry, and loving in the morning; and at
night stretched before me in death. It was an awful accident! and I--I have
never cared quite so much for the world since. Maria was--what is it? Come in.&quot;</p>
<p>A knock at the door had disturbed the reflections. Mr. Castlemaine let fall
his coat tails, which he had then caught up, and turned his head to it. A man
servant appeared.</p>
<p>&quot;Commodore Teague wants to know, sir, whether he may get those two or three
barrow-loads of wood moved to the Hutt to-day. He'd like to, he says, if it's
convenient.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, he can have it done. Is he here, Miles?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, sir; he is waiting in the yard.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll come and speak to him.&quot;</p>
<p>And the Master of Greylands, taking the two letters from the side-table, left
the room to descend, shutting the door behind him.</p>
<p>We must turn for a few minutes to the Dolphin Inn, and to the previous
evening. Nothing could well have exceeded John Bent's consternation when his
guest, the unknown stranger, had revealed his name. Anthony Castlemaine! Not
quite at first, but after a short interval, the landlord saw how it must
be--that he was the son of the late Basil Castlemaine. And he was not the best
pleased to hear it in the moment's annoyance.</p>
<p>&quot;You ought to have told me, sir,&quot; he stammered in his confusion. &quot;It was
unkind to take me at a disadvantage. Here have I been using liberties with the
family's name, supposing I was talking to an utter stranger!&quot;</p>
<p>The frank expression of the young man's face, the pleasant look in his fine
brown eyes, tended to reassure the landlord, even better than words.</p>
<p>&quot;You have not said a syllable of my family that I could take exception to,&quot;
he freely said. &quot;You knew my father: will you shake hands with me, John Bent, as
his son?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are too good, sir; and I meant no harm by my gossip,&quot; said the landlord,
meeting the offered hand. &quot;You must be the son of Mr. Basil. It's a great many
years since he went away, and I was but a youngster, but I remember him. Your
face is nearly the same as his was, sir. The likeness was puzzling me beyond
everything. I hope Mr. Basil is well, sir.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; said the young man, &quot;he is dead. And I have come over here, as his son
and heir, to claim Greylands' Rest.&quot;</p>
<p>It was even so. The facts were as young Anthony Castlemaine stated. And a
short summary of past events must be given here.</p>
<p>When Basil Castlemaine went abroad so many years ago, in his hot-blooded
youth, he spent some of the first years roaming about: seeing the world, he
called it. Later, circumstances brought him acquainted with a young English
lady, whose friends lived in France, in the province of Dauphin: which, as the
world knows, is close on the borders of Italy. They had settled near a place
called Gap, and were in commerce there, owning some extensive silk-mills. Basil
Castlemaine, tired probably of his wandering life, and of being a beau garon,
married this young lady, put all the money he had left (it was a very tolerably
good sum) into the silk-mills, and became a partner. There he had remained. He
liked the climate; he liked the French mode of life; he liked the business he
had engaged in. Not once had he re-visited England. He was by nature a most
obstinate man, retaining anger for ever, and he would not give token of
remembrance to the father and brothers who, in his opinion, had been too glad to
get rid of him. No doubt they had. But, though he did not allow them to hear of
him, he heard occasionally of them. An old acquaintance of his, who was the son
of one Squire Dobie, living some few miles on the other side Stilborough, wrote
to him every two years, or so, and gave him news. But this correspondence (if
letters written only on one side could be called such, for all Tom Dobie ever
received back was a newspaper, sent in token that his letter had reached its
destination) was carried on en cachette; and Tom Dobie never disclosed it to
living mortal, having undertaken not to do so. Some two years before the present
period, Tom Dobie had died: his letters of course ceased, and it was by the
merest accident that Basil Castlemaine heard of the death of his father. He was
then himself too ill to return and put in his claim to Greylands' Rest; in fact,
he was near to death; but he charged his son to go to England and claim the
estate as soon as he should be no more; nay, as he said, to enter into
possession of it. But he made use of a peculiar warning in giving this charge to
his son; and these were the words:</p>
<p>&quot;Take you care what you are about, Anthony, and go to work cautiously. There
may be treachery in store for you. The brothers--your uncles--who combined to
drive me away from our homestead in days gone by, may combine again to keep you
out of it. Take care of yourself, I say; feel your way, as it were; and beware
of treachery.&quot;</p>
<p>Whether, as is supposed sometimes to be the case, the dying man had some
prevision of the future, and saw, as by instinct, what that future would bring
forth, certain it was, that he made use of this warning to young Anthony: and
equally certain that the end bore out the necessity for the caution.</p>
<p>So here was Anthony Castlemaine: arrived in the land of his family to put in
his claim to what he deemed was his lawful inheritance, Greylands' Rest, the
deep black band worn for his father yet fresh upon his hat.</p>
<p>Mrs. Castlemaine sat in the red parlour, reading a letter. Or, rather,
re-reading it, for it was one that had arrived earlier in the morning. A lady at
Stilborough had applied for the vacant place of Governess to Miss Flora
Castlemaine, and had enclosed her testimonials.</p>
<p>&quot;Good music, singing, drawing; no French,&quot; read Mrs. Castlemaine aloud,
partly for the benefit of Miss Flora, who stood on a stool at her elbow, not at
all pleased that any such application should come; for, as we have already seen,
the young lady would prefer to bring herself up without the aid of any
governess. &quot;Good tempered, but an excellent disciplinarian, and very firm with
her pupils----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not going to have <i>her</i>, mamma,&quot; came the interruption. &quot;Don't you
think it!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I do not suppose you will have her, Flora. The want of French will be an
insuperable objection. How tiresome it is! One seems unable to get everything.
The last lady who applied was not a sufficient musician for advanced pupils, and
therefore could not have undertaken Ethel's music.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As if Ethel needed to learn music still! Why, she plays as well--as well,&quot;
concluded the girl, at a loss for a simile. &quot;Catch me learning music when I'm as
old as Ethel!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I consider, it nonsense myself, but Ethel wishes it, and your papa so
foolishly gives in to her whims in all things that of course she has to be
studied in the matter as much as you. It may be months and months before we get
a lady who combines all that's wanted <i>here</i>.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Castlemaine spoke resentfully. What with one thing and another, she
generally was in a state of resentment against Ethel.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope it may be years and years!&quot; cried Flora, leaning her arms on the
table and kicking her legs about. &quot;I hope we shall never get one at all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It would be easy enough to get one, but for this trouble about Ethel's
music,&quot; grumbled Mrs. Castlemaine. &quot;I have a great mind to send her to the Grey
Nunnery for her lessons. Sister Charlotte, I know, is perfect on the piano; and
she would be thankful for the employment.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Papa would not let her go to the Nunnery,&quot; said the sharp girl. &quot;He does not
like the Grey Ladies.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I suppose he'd not. I'm sure, what with this disqualification and that
disqualification, a good governess is as difficult to fix upon as----get off the
table, my sweet child,&quot; hastily broke off Mrs. Castlemaine: &quot;here's your papa.&quot;</p>
<p>The Master of Greylands entered the red parlour, after his short interview in
the yard with Commodore Teague. Miss Flora slipped past him, and disappeared. He
saw a good deal to find fault with in her rude, tomboy ways; and she avoided him
when she could. Taking the paper, he stirred the fire into a blaze, just as he
had, not many minutes before, stirred his own fire upstairs.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a biting-cold day,&quot; he observed. &quot;I think I must have caught a little
chill, for I seem to feel cold in an unusual degree. What's that?&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Castlemaine held the letters still in her hand; and by the expression of
her countenance, bent upon the contents, he could perceive there was some
annoyance.</p>
<p>&quot;<i>This</i> governess does not do; it is as bad as the last. She lacked
music; this one lacks French. Is it not provoking, James?&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Castlemaine took up the letters and read them.</p>
<p>&quot;I should say she is just the sort of governess for Flora,&quot; he observed. &quot;The
testimonials are excellent.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But her want of French! Did you not observe that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know that French is of so much consequence for Flora as the getting
a suitable person to control her. One who will hold her under firm discipline.
As it is, she is being ruined.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;French not of consequence for Flora!&quot; repeated Mrs. Castlemaine. &quot;What can
you mean, James?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I said it was not of so much consequence, relatively speaking. Neither is
it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And while Ethel's French is perfect!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What has that to do with it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I will never submit to see Flora inferior in accomplishments to Ethel,
James. French I hold especially by: I have felt the want of it myself. Better,
of the two, for her to fail in music than in speaking French. If it were not for
Ethel's senseless whim of continuing to take music lessons, there would be no
trouble.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who's this, I wonder?&quot; cried Mr. Castlemaine.</p>
<p>He alluded to a visitor's ring at the hall bell. Flora came dashing in.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a gentleman in a fur coat,&quot; she said. &quot;I watched him come up the
avenue.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A gentleman in a fur coat!&quot; repeated her mother.</p>
<p>&quot;Some one who has walked from Stilborough this cold day, I suppose.&quot;</p>
<p>Miles entered. On his small silver waiter lay a card. He presented it to his
master and spoke. &quot;The gentleman says he wishes to see you, sir. I have shown
him into the drawing-room.&quot;</p>
<p>The Master of Greylands was gazing at the card with knitted brow and haughty
lips. He did not understand the name on it.</p>
<p>&quot;What farce is this?&quot; he exclaimed, tossing the card on the table in anger.
And Mrs. Castlemaine bent to read it with aroused curiosity.</p>
<p>&quot;<i>Anthony Castlemaine</i>.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It must be an old card of your father's, James,&quot; she remarked, &quot;given, most
likely, year's ago, to some one to send in, should he ever require to present
himself here--perhaps to crave a favour.&quot;</p>
<p>This view, just at the moment it was spoken, seemed feasible enough to Mr.
Castlemaine, and his brow lost its fierceness. Another minute, and he saw how
untenable it was.</p>
<p>&quot;My father never had such a card as this, Sophia. Plain 'Anthony
Castlemaine,' without hold or handle. His cards had 'Mr.' before the name. And
look at the strokes and flourishes--it's not like an English card. What sort of
a person is it, Miles?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A youngish gentleman sir. He has a lot of dark fur on his coat. He asked for
Mr. James Castlemaine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. <i>James</i> Castlemaine!&quot; echoed the Master of Greylands, sharply, as
he stalked from the room, card in hand.</p>
<p>The visitor was standing before a portrait in the drawing-room contemplating
it earnestly. It was that of old Anthony Castlemaine, taken when he was about
fifty years of age. At the opening of the door he turned round and advanced, his
hand, extended and a pleasant smile on his face.</p>
<p>&quot;I have the gratification, I fancy, of seeing my Uncle James!&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Castlemaine kept his hands to himself. He looked haughtily at the
intruder; he spoke frigidly.</p>
<p>&quot;I have not the honour of your acquaintance, sir.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But my card tells you who I am,&quot; rejoined the young man. &quot;I am indeed your
nephew, uncle; the son of your elder brother. He was Basil, and you are James.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pardon me, sir, if I tell you what <i>I</i> think you are. An impostor.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah no, do not be afraid, uncle. I am verily your nephew, Anthony
Castlemaine. I have papers and legal documents with me to prove indisputably the
fact; I bring you also a letter from my father, written on his death-bed. But I
should have thought you might know me by my likeness to my father; and he--I
could fancy that portrait had been taken for him&quot;--pointing to the one he had
been looking at. &quot;He always said I greatly resembled my grandfather.&quot;</p>
<p>There could be no dispute as to the likeness. The young man's face was the
Castlemaine face exactly: the well formed, handsome features, the clear and
fresh complexion, the brilliant dark eyes. All the Castlemaines had been alike,
and this one was like them all; even like James, who stood there.</p>
<p>Taking a letter from his pocket-book, he handed it to Mr. Castlemaine. The
latter broke the seal--Basil's own seal; he saw that--and began to peruse it.
While he did so, he reflected a little, and made up his mind.</p>
<p>To acknowledge his nephew. For he had the sense to see that no other resource
would be left him. He did it with a tolerably good grace, but in a reserved cold
kind of manner. Folding up the letter, he asked a few questions which young
Anthony freely answered, and gave a brief account of the past.</p>
<p>&quot;And Basil--your father--is dead, you say! Has been dead four weeks. This
letter, I see, is dated Christmas Day.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was on Christmas Day he wrote it, uncle. Yes, nearly four weeks have
elapsed since his death: it took place on the fourteenth of January; his wife,
my dear mother, had died on the same day six years before. That was curious, was
it not? I had meant to come over here immediately, as he charged me to do; but
there were many matters of business to be settled, and I could not get away
until now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Have you come over for any particular purpose?&quot; coldly asked Mr.
Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;I have come to stay, Uncle James. To take possession of my inheritance.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of your inheritance?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The estate of Greylands' Rest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Greylands' Rest is not yours,&quot; said Mr. Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;My father informed me that it was. He brought me up to no profession: he
always said that Greylands' Rest would be mine at his own death; that he should
come into it himself at the death of his father, and thence it would descend to
me. To make all sure, he left it to me in his will. And, as I have mentioned to
you, we did not hear my grandfather was dead until close upon last Christmas.
Had my father known it in the summer, he would have come over to put in his
claim: he was in sufficiently good health then.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is a pity you should have come so far on a fruitless errand, young man.
Listen. When your father, Basil, abandoned his home here in his youth, he
forfeited all claim to the inheritance. He asked for his portion, and had it; he
took it away with him and <i>stayed</i> away; stayed away for nigh upon forty
years. What claim does he suppose that sort of conduct gave him on my father's
affection, that he should leave to him Greylands' Rest?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He always said his father would leave it to no one but him: that he knew it
and, was sure of it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What my father might have done had Basil come back during his lifetime, I
cannot pretend to say: neither is it of any consequence to guess at it now.
Basil did not come back, and, therefore, you cannot be surprised that he missed
Greylands' Rest; that the old father left it to his second son--myself--instead
of to him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But did he leave it to you, uncle?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A superfluous question, young man. I succeeded to it, and am here in
possession of it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am told that there are doubts upon the point abroad,&quot; returned Anthony,
speaking in the same pleasant tone, but with straightforward candour.</p>
<p>&quot;Doubts upon what point?&quot; haughtily demanded Mr. Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;What I hear is this, Uncle James. That it is not known to the public, and
never has been known, how you came into Greylands' Rest. Whether the estate was
left to you by will, or handed over to you by deed of gift, or given to you in
trust to hold for my father. Nobody knows, I am told, anything about it, or even
whether there was or was not a will. Perhaps you will give me these particulars,
uncle?&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Castlemaine's face grew dark as night. &quot;Do you presume to doubt my word,
young man? I tell you that Greylands' Rest is mine. Let it content you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you will show me that Greylands' Rest is yours, Uncle James, I will never
say another word upon the subject, or give you the smallest trouble. Prove this
to me, and I will stay a few days in the neighbourhood, for the sake of
cementing family ties--though I may never meet any of you again--and then go
back to the place whence I came. But if you do not give me this proof, I must
prosecute my claim, and maintain my rights.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Rights!&quot; scoffed Mr. Castlemaine, beginning to lose his temper. &quot;How dare
you presume to talk to <i>me</i> in this way? A needy adventurer--for that is
what I conclude you are, left without means of your own--to come here, and----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I beg your pardon,&quot; interrupted the young man; &quot;I am not needy. Though far
from rich, I have a fair competency. Enough to keep me in comfort.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is all one to me,&quot; said Mr. Castlemaine. &quot;You had better do as you
say--go back to the place whence you came.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If the estate be truly and lawfully yours, I should be the last to attempt
to disturb you in it; I should not wish to do so. But if it be not yours, Uncle
James, it must be mine; and, until I can be assured one way or the other, I
shall remain here, though it be for ever.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Castlemaine drew himself up to his full height. He was perfectly calm
again; perhaps somewhat vexed that he had allowed himself to betray temper; and
rejoined, coolly and prudently, &quot;I cannot pretend to control your movements; to
say you shall go, or you shall come; but I tell you, frankly, that your staying
will not serve you in the least. Were you to remain for ever--as you phrase
it--not one tittle of proof would you get from me. Things have come to a pretty
pass if I am to be bearded in my own house, and have my word doubted.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, Uncle James,&quot; said the young man, still speaking pleasantly, &quot;then
nothing remains for me but to try and find out the truth for myself. I wish you
had been more explicit with me, for I am sure I do not know how to set about
it,&quot; he added, candidly.</p>
<p>A faint, proud smile curled Mr. Castlemaine's decisive lips. It seemed to
say, &quot;Do what you please; it is beneath my notice.&quot; His nephew took up his hat
to depart.</p>
<p>&quot;May I offer to shake hands with you, Uncle James? I hope we need not be
enemies?&quot;</p>
<p>A moment's hesitation, and Mr. Castlemaine shook the offered hand. It was
next to impossible to resist the frank geniality; just the same frank geniality
that had characterized Basil; and Mr. Castlemaine thawed a little.</p>
<p>&quot;It appears to be a very strange thing that Basil should have remained
stationary all those years in Franco; never once to have come home!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have heard him say many a time, Uncle James, that he should never return
until he returned to take possession of Greylands' Rest. And during the time of
the great war travelling was dangerous and difficult.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Neither could I have believed that he would have settled down so quietly.
And to engage in commerce!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He grew to like the bustle of business. He had a vast capacity for business,
Uncle James.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No doubt; being a Castlemaine,&quot; was the answer, delivered with conscious
superiority. &quot;The Castlemaines lack capacity for nothing they may choose to
undertake. Good-morning; and I wish you a better errand next time.&quot;</p>
<p>As Anthony Castlemaine, on departing, neared the gate leading to the avenue,
he saw a young lady approaching it. A fisherman, to whom she was speaking,
walked by her side. The latter's words, as he turned away, caught the ear of
Anthony.</p>
<p>&quot;You will tell the master then; please, Miss Castlemaine, and say a good word
to him for me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I will, Gleeson; and I am very sorry for the misfortune,&quot; the young
lady answered. &quot;Good-day.&quot;</p>
<p>Anthony gazed with unfeigned pleasure on the beautiful face presented to him
in--as he supposed--his cousin. It was Ethel Reene. The cheeks had acquired a
soft rose flush in the crisp air, the dark brown hair took a wonderfully bright
tinge in the sunshine; and in the deep eyes glancing so straight and honestly
through their long dark lashes into those of the stranger, there was a sweet
candour that caused Anthony Castlemaine to think them the prettiest eyes he had
ever seen. He advanced to her direct; said a few words indicative of his delight
at meeting her; and, while Ethel was lost in astonishment, he suddenly bent his
face forward, and kissed her on either cheek.</p>
<p>For a moment, Ethel Reene was speechless bewildered with confused indignation
at the outrage; and then she burst into a flood of tears. What she said, she
hardly knew; but all bespoke her shivering, sensitive sense of the insult.
Anthony Castlemaine was overwhelmed. He had intended no insult, but only to give
a cousinly greeting after the fashion of his adopted land; and he hastened to
express his contrition.</p>
<p>&quot;I beg your pardon a million times. I am so grieved to have pained or
offended you. I think you cannot have understood that I am your cousin?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Cousin, sir,&quot; she rejoined--and Mr. Castlemaine himself could not have
spoken with a more haughty contempt. &quot;How dare you presume? I have not a cousin
or a relative in the wide world.&quot;</p>
<p>The sweet eyes were flashing, the delicate face was flushed to crimson. It
occurred to Anthony Castlemaine that he must have made some unfortunate mistake.</p>
<p>&quot;I know not how to beg your pardon sufficiently,&quot; he continued. &quot;I thought
indeed you were my cousin, Miss Castlemaine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am not Miss Castlemaine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I--pardon me!--I assuredly heard the sailor address you as Miss
Castlemaine.&quot;</p>
<p>Ethel was beginning to recover herself. She saw that he did not look at all
like a young man who would gratuitously offer any lady an insult, but like a
true gentleman. Moreover there flashed upon her perception the strong likeness
his face bore to the Castlemaines; and she thought that what he had done he must
have done in some error.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not Miss Castlemaine,&quot; she condescended to explain, her tone losing
part of its anger, but not its pride. &quot;Mr. Castlemaine's house is my home, and
people often call me by the name. But--and if I were Miss Castlemaine, who are
you, sir, that you should claim to be my cousin? The Castlemaines have no
strange cousins.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am Anthony Castlemaine, young lady; son of the late Basil Castlemaine, the
heir of Greylands. I come from an interview with my Uncle James; and I--I beg
your pardon most heartily once more.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Anthony Castlemaine, the son of Basil Castlemaine!&quot; she exclaimed, nearly
every emotion forgotten in astonishment; but a conviction, nevertheless, seizing
upon her that it was true. &quot;The son of the lost Basil!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am, in very truth, his son,&quot; replied Anthony. &quot;My father is dead, and I
have come over to claim--and I hope, enter into--my patrimony, Greylands' Rest.&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>

<h4><a name="div1_05" href="#div1Ref_05">CHAPTER V.</a></h4>
<h5>THE BALL.</h5>
<br>

<p>Lights gleamed from the rooms of the banker's house in Stilborough. A flood
of light blazed from the hall, and was reflected on the pavement outside, and on
the colours of the flowering plants just within the entrance. Mr. Peter
Castlemaine and Miss Castlemaine gave a dance that night; and it was the custom
to open the door early, and keep it open, for the arrival of the expected
guests.</p>
<p>The reception-rooms were in readiness, and gay with their wax lights and
flowers. They opened mostly into one another. The largest of them was
appropriated to dancing. All its furniture and its carpet had been removed;
benches occupied the walls under the innumerable sconces bearing lights; and the
floor was chalked artistically, in a handsome pattern of flowers, after the
fashion of the day.</p>
<p>In the small apartment that was her own sitting-room stood Mary Ursula. In
her rich robes of white silk and lace, and in the jewels which had been her
mother's, and which it was her father's wish she should wear on grand occasions,
she looked, with her stately form and her most lovely face, of almost regal
beauty. Excitement had flushed her cheeks to brightness; on her delicate and
perfect features sat an animation not often seen there. Whatever evil might be
overhanging the house, at least no prevision of it rested on Miss Castlemaine;
and perhaps few young ladies in all the kingdom could be found who were
possessed of the requisites for happiness in a degree that could vie with the
banker's daughter, or who had so entire a sense of it. Beautiful, amiable,
clever, rich; the darling of her father; sheltered from every care in her
sumptuous home; loving and beloved by a young man worthy of her, and to whom she
was soon to be united! In the days to come, Mary Ursula would look back on this
time, and tell herself that the very intensity of its happiness might have
warned her that it was too bright to last.</p>
<p>He, her lover, was by her side now. He had come early, on purpose to be for a
few minutes alone with her, before the arrival of the other guests. They stood
together on the hearthrug. A quiet-looking young man of middle height, with dark
hair, just the shade of hers, and rather a pensive and mild cast of face: a
face, however, that did not seem to proclaim much moral strength. Such was
William Blake-Gordon.</p>
<p>They were conversing of the future; the future that to both of them looked so
bright; of the home and home life that ere long would be theirs in common. Mr.
Blake-Gordon had been for some little time searching for a house, and had not
met with a suitable one. But he thought he had found it now.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems to me to be just the thing, Mary,&quot; he was saying--for he never
called her by her double name, but &quot;Mary&quot; simply. &quot;Only four miles from
Stilborough on the Loughton road; which will be within an easy distance of your
father's home and of Sir Richard's. It was by the merest chance I heard this
morning that the Wests were going; and we can secure it at once if we will,
before it goes into the market.&quot;</p>
<p>Miss Castlemaine knew the house by sight; she had passed it many a time in
her drives, and seen it nestling away amid the trees. It was called by rather a
fanciful name--Raven's Priory.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not to be let, you say, William; only bought.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Only bought. There will be, I presume, no difficulty made to that by the
authorities.&quot;</p>
<p>He spoke with a smile. She smiled too. Difficulty!--with the loads of wealth
that would be theirs some time! They might well laugh at the idea.</p>
<p>&quot;Only that--that it is uncertain how long we may require to live in it,&quot; she
said, with a slight hesitation. &quot;I suppose that--some time----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We shall have to leave it for my father's home. True. But that, I trust, may
be a long while off. And then we could re-sell Raven's Priory.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, of course. It is a nice place, William?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Charming,&quot; he replied with enthusiasm. For, of course, all things, the
proposed residence included, were to him the hue of couleur-de-rose.</p>
<p>&quot;I have never been inside it,&quot; she observed.</p>
<p>&quot;No. The Wests are churlish people, keeping no company. Report says that Mrs.
West is a hypochondriac. They let me go in this morning, and I went over all the
house. It is the nicest place, love--and not too large or too small for us; and
the Wests have kept it in good condition. You will be charmed with the
drawing-rooms, Mary; and the conservatory is one of the best I ever saw. They
want us to take to the plants.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are they nice?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Beautiful. The Wests are moving to London, to be near good advice for her,
and they do not expect to get anything of a conservatory there; at least, that
is worth the name. I wonder what your papa will think about this house, Mary? We
might tell him of it now. Where is he?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He is out,&quot; she answered. &quot;Just as he was going up to dress, Thomas Hill
sent for him downstairs, and they went out somewhere together. Papa ran up to
tell me he would be back as soon as he could, but that I must for once receive
the people alone.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wish I might stand by your side to help receive them!&quot; he said,
impulsively. &quot;Would any of them faint at it? Do you think Mrs. Webb would, if
she were here?&quot; he continued, with a smile. &quot;Ah, well--a short while, my
darling, and I shall have the right to stand by you.&quot;</p>
<p>He stole his arm round her waist, and whispered to her a repetition of those
love vows that had so often before charmed her ear and thrilled her heart. Her
cheek touched his shoulder; the faint perfume of her costly fan, that she swayed
unconsciously as it hung from her wrist, was to him like an odour from Paradise.
He recounted to her all the features he remembered of the house that neither of
them doubted would be their future home; and the minutes passed, in, to both,
bliss unutterable.</p>
<p>The crashing up of a carriage--of two carriages it seemed--warned them that
this sweet pastime was at an end. Sounds of bustle in the hall succeeded to it:
the servants were receiving the first guests.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, William--I forgot--I meant to tell you,&quot; she hurriedly whispered. &quot;I had
the most ugly dream last night. And you know I very rarely do dream. I have not
been able to get it out of my mind all day.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What is it, Mary?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I thought we were separated, you and I; separated for ever. We had
quarrelled, I think; that point was not clear; but you turned off one way, and I
another. It was in the gallery of this house, William, and we had been talking
together. You went out at the other end, by the door near the dining-room, and I
at this end; and we turned at the last and looked at one another. Oh, the look
was dreadful! I shall never forget it: so full of pain and sadness! And we knew,
both of us knew, that it was the last farewell look; that we should never again
meet in this world.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, my love! my love!&quot; he murmured, bending his face on hers. &quot;And you could
let it trouble you!--knowing it was but a dream! Nothing but the decree of
God--death--shall ever separate us, Mary. For weal or for woe, we will go
through the life here together.&quot;</p>
<p>He kissed away the tears that had gathered in her eyes at the remembrance;
and Miss Castlemaine turned hastily into one of the larger rooms, and took up
her standing there in expectation. For the feet of the gay world were already
traversing the gallery.</p>
<p>She welcomed her guests, soon coming in thick and threefold, with the
gracious manner and the calm repose of bearing that always characterised her,
apologising to all for the absence of her father; telling that he had been
called out unexpectedly on some matter of business, but would soon return. Amid
others, came the party from Greylands' Rest, arriving rather late: Mrs.
Castlemaine in black velvet, leaning on the arm of her stepson; Ethel Reene
walking modestly behind, in a simple dress of white net, adorned with white
ribbons. There was many a fine young man present, but never a finer or more
attractive one than Harry Castlemaine; with the handsome Castlemaine features,
the easy, independent bearing, and the ready tongue.</p>
<p>&quot;Is it of any use to ask whether you are at liberty to honour me with your
hand for the first dance, Mary Ursula?&quot; he inquired, after leaving Mrs.
Castlemaine on a sofa.</p>
<p>&quot;Not the least, Harry,&quot; answered Miss Castlemaine, smiling. &quot;I am engaged for
that, and for the second as well.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course. Well, it is all as it should be, I suppose. Given the presence of
Mr. Blake-Gordon, and no one else has so good a right as he to open the ball
with you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You will find a substitute for me by the asking, Harry. See all those young
ladies around; not one but is glancing towards you with the hope that you may
seek her.&quot;</p>
<p>He laughed rather consciously. He was perfectly well aware of the universal
favour accorded by the ladies, young and old, to Harry Castlemaine. But this
time, at any rate, he intended to disappoint them all. He turned to Miss Reene.</p>
<p>&quot;Will you take compassion upon a rejected man, Ethel? Mary Ursula won't have
me for the first two dances, you hear; so I appeal to you in all humility to
heal the smart. Don't reject me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nonsense, Harry!&quot; was the young lady's answer. &quot;You must not ask <i>me</i>
for the first dance; it would be like brother and sister dancing together; all
the room would resent it in you, and call it bad manners. Choose elsewhere.
There's Miss Mountsorrel; she will not say you nay.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;For the dances, no but she'll not condescend to speak three words to me
while they are in process,&quot; returned Mr. Harry Castlemaine. &quot;If you do not dance
them with me, Ethel, I shall sit down until the two first dances are over.&quot;</p>
<p>He spoke still in the same laughing, half joking manner; but, nevertheless,
there was a ring of decision in the tone of the last words; and Ethel knew he
meant what he said. The Castlemaines rarely broke through any decision they
might announce, however lightly it was spoken; and Harry possessed somewhat of
the same persistent will.</p>
<p>&quot;If you make so great a point of it, I will dance with you,&quot; observed Ethel.
&quot;But I must again say that you ought to take anyone rather than me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have not seen my uncle yet,&quot; remarked Miss Castlemaine to Ethel, as Harry
strolled away to pay his devoirs to the room generally. &quot;Where can he be
lingering?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Papa is not here, Mary Ursula.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not here! How is that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Really I don't know,&quot; replied Ethel. &quot;When Harry came running out to get
into the carriage to-night--we had been sitting in it quite five minutes waiting
for him but he had been away all day, and was late in dressing--Miles shut the
door. 'Don't do that,' said Harry to him, 'the master's not here.' Upon that,
Mrs. Castlemaine spoke, and said papa was not coming with us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I suppose he will be coming in later,&quot; remarked Mary Ursula, as she moved
away to meet fresh guests.</p>
<p>The dancing began with a country dance; or, as would have been said then, the
ball opened with one. Miss Castlemaine and her lover, Mr. Blake-Gordon, took
their places at its head; Harry Castlemaine and Miss Reene were next to them.
For in those days, people stood much upon etiquette at these assemblies, and the
young ladies of the family took precedence of all others in the opening dance.</p>
<p>The dance chosen was called the Triumph. Harry Castlemaine led Mary Ursula
down between the line of admiring spectators; her partner, Mr. Blake-Gordon,
followed, and they brought the young lady back in triumph. Such was the
commencement of the figure. It was a sight to be remembered in after years; the
singular good looks of at least two of the three; Harry, the sole male heir of
the Castlemaines, with the tall fine form and the handsome face; and Mary
Ursula, so stately and beautiful. Ethel Reene was standing alone, in her quiet
loveliness, looking like a snowdrop, and waiting until her turn should come to
be in like manner taken down. The faces of all sparkled with animation and
happiness; the gala robes of the two young ladies added to the charm of the
scene. Many recalled it later; recalled it with a pang: for, of those four, ere
a year had gone by, one was not, and another's life had been blighted. No
prevision, however, rested on any of them this night of what the dark future
held in store; and they revelled in the moment's enjoyment, gay at heart. Heaven
is too merciful to let Fate cast its ominous shade on us before the needful
time.</p>
<p>The banker came in ere the first dance was over. Moving about from room to
room among his guests, glancing with approving smile at the young dancers,
seeing that the card-tables were filled, he at length reached the sofa of Mrs.
Castlemaine. She happened to be alone on it just then, and he sat down beside
her.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't see James anywhere,&quot; he remarked. &quot;Where is he hiding himself?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He has not come,&quot; replied Mrs. Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;No! How's that? James enjoys a ball.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I think he does still, nearly as much as his son Harry.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then what has kept him away?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I really do not know. I had thought nearly to the last that he meant to
come. When I was all but ready myself, finding James had not begun to dress, I
sent Harriet to remind him of the lateness of the hour, and she brought word
back that her master was not going.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did he say why?&quot; asked Mr. Peter Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;No! I knocked at his study door afterwards and found him seated at his
bureau. He seemed busy. All he said to me was, that he should remain at home;
neither more nor less. You know, Peter, James rarely troubles himself to give a
reason for what he does.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I am sorry. Sorry that he should miss a pleasant evening, and also
because I wanted to speak to him. We may not have many more of these social
meetings.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I suppose not,&quot; said Mrs. Castlemaine, assuming that her brother-in-law
alluded in an indirect way to his daughter's approaching marriage. &quot;When once
you have lost Mary Ursula, there will be nobody to hold, festivities for.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; said the banker, absently.</p>
<p>&quot;I suppose it will be very soon now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What will be soon?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The wedding. James thinks it will be after Easter.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh--ay--the wedding,&quot; spoke Mr. Peter Castlemaine, with the air of a man who
has just caught up some recollection that had slipped from him. &quot;I don't know
yet: we shall see: no time has been decided on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Close as his brother&quot; thought Mrs. Castlemaine. &quot;No likelihood, that he will
disclose anything unless he chooses.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Will James be coming in to Stilborough to-morrow?&quot; asked the banker.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sure I cannot tell. He goes out and comes in, you know, without any
reference to me. I should fancy he would <i>not</i> be coming in, unless he has
anything to call him. He has not seemed well to-day; he thinks he has caught a
cold.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, then I daresay that's the secret of his staying at home to-night,&quot; said
Mr. Peter Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, it may be. I did not think of that. And he has also been very much
annoyed to-day: and you know, Peter, if once James is thoroughly put out of
temper, it takes some little time to put him in again.&quot;</p>
<p>The banker nodded assent.</p>
<p>&quot;What has annoyed him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A very curious thing,&quot; replied Mrs. Castlemaine: &quot;you will hardly believe it
when I tell you. Some young man----&quot;</p>
<p>Breaking off suddenly, she glanced around to make sure that no one was within
hearing. Then drawing nearer to the banker, went on in a lowered voice:</p>
<p>&quot;Some young man presented himself this morning at Greylands' Rest, pretending
to want to put in a claim to the estate.&quot;</p>
<p>Abstracted though the banker had been throughout the brief interview, these
words aroused him to the quick. In one moment he was the calm, shrewd, attentive
business man, Peter Castlemaine, his head erect, his keen eyes observant.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not understand you, Mrs. Castlemaine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Neither do I understand,&quot; she rejoined. &quot;James said just a word or two to
me, and I gathered the rest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who was the young man?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Flora described him as wearing a coat trimmed with fur; and Miles thought he
spoke with somewhat of a foreign accent,&quot; replied Mrs. Castlemaine, deviating
unconsciously from the question, as ladies sometimes do deviate.</p>
<p>&quot;But don't you know who he was? Did he give no account of himself?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He calls himself Anthony Castlemaine.&quot;</p>
<p>As the name left her lips a curious kind of change, as though he were
startled, passed momentarily over the banker's countenance. But he neither
stirred nor spoke.</p>
<p>&quot;When the card was brought in with that name upon it--James happened to be in
the red parlour, talking with me about a new governess--I said it must be an old
card of your father's that somebody had got hold of. But it turned out not to be
that: and, indeed, it was not like the old cards. What he wants to make out is,
that he is the son of Basil Castlemaine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did James see him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh dear yes, and their interview lasted more than an hour.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And he told James he was Basil's son?--this young man.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think so. At any rate, the young man told Ethel he was. She happened to
meet him as he was leaving the house and he introduced himself to her as Anthony
Castlemaine, Basil's son, and said he had come over to claim his
inheritance--Greylands' Rest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And where's Basil?&quot; asked the banker, after a pause.</p>
<p>&quot;Dead.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dead?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So the young man wishes to make appear. My opinion is he must be some
impostor.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An impostor no doubt,&quot; assented the banker, slowly. &quot;At least--he may be. I
only wonder that we have not, under the circumstances, had people here before,
claiming to be connected with Basil.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And I am sure the matter has annoyed James very much,&quot; pursued Mrs.
Castlemaine. &quot;He betrayed it in his manner, and was not at all like himself all
the afternoon. I should make short work of it if the man came again, were I
James, and threaten him with the law.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Peter Castlemaine said no more, and presently rose to join other of his
guests. But as he talked to one, laughed with another, listened to a third, his
head bent in attention, his eyes looking straight into their eyes, none had an
idea that these signs of interest were evinced mechanically, and that his mind
was far away.</p>
<p>He had enough perplexity and trouble of his own just then, as Heaven knew;
very much indeed on this particular evening; but this other complexity, that
appeared to be arising for his brother James, added to it. To Mrs. Castlemaine's
scornfully expressed opinion that the man was an impostor, he had assented just
in the same way that he was now talking with his guests--mechanically. For some
instinct, or prevision, call it what you will, lay on the banker's heart, that
the man would turn out to be no impostor, but the veritable son of the exile,
Basil.</p>
<p>Peter Castlemaine was much attached to his brother James, and for James's own
sake he would have regretted that any annoyance or trouble should arise for him;
but he had also a selfish motive for regretting it. In his dire strait as to
money--for to that it had now come--he had been rapidly making up his mind that
evening to appeal to James to let him have some. The appeal might not be
successful under the most favourable auspices: he knew that: but with this
trouble looming for the Master of Greylands, he foresaw that it must and would
fail. Greylands' Rest might be James's in all legal security; but an impression
had lain on the mind of Peter Castlemaine, since his father's death, that if
Basil ever returned he would set up a fight for it.</p>
<p>Supper over--the elaborate, heavy, sit-down supper of those days--and the two
dances following upon it, most of the guests departed. Mr. Blake-Gordon, seeking
about for the banker to wish him goodnight, at length found him standing over
the fire in the deserted card-room. Absorbed though he was in his own happiness,
the young man could but notice the flood-tide of care on the banker's brow. It
cleared off, as though by magic, when the banker looked up and saw him.</p>
<p>&quot;Is it you, William? I thought you had left.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I should hardly go, sir, without wishing you goodnight. What a delightful
evening it has been!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ay, I think you have all enjoyed yourselves.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, very, very much.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, youth is the time for enjoyment,&quot; observed the banker. &quot;We can never
again find the zest in it, once youth is past.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You look tired, sir; otherwise I--I might have ventured to trespass on you
for five minutes' conversation, late though it be,&quot; pursued Mr. Blake-Gordon
with some hesitation.</p>
<p>&quot;Tired!--not at all. You may take five minutes; and five to that, William.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is about our future residence, sir. Raven's Priory is in the market: and
I think--and Mary thinks--it will just suit us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ay; I heard more than a week ago that the Wests were leaving.&quot;</p>
<p>The words took William Blake-Gordon by surprise. He looked at the banker.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you, sir!--more than a week ago! And did it not strike you that it would
be a very suitable place for us?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot say that I thought much about it,&quot; was the banker's answer; and he
was twirling an ornament on the mantelpiece about with his hand as he spoke: a
small, costly vase of old china from Dresden.</p>
<p>&quot;But <i>don't</i> you think it would be, sir?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I daresay it might be. The gardens and conservatories have been well kept
up; and you and Mary Ursula have both a weakness for rare flowers.&quot;</p>
<p>That was perfectly true. And the &quot;weakness&quot; showed itself then, for the young
man went off into a rapturous description of the wealth of Raven's Priory in
respect of floriculture. The ten minutes slipped away to twenty; and in his own
enthusiasm Mr. Blake-Gordon did not notice the absence of it in his hearer.</p>
<p>&quot;But I must not keep you longer, sir,&quot; he suddenly said, as his eyes caught
the hands of the clock. &quot;Perhaps you will let me see you about it to-morrow. Or
allow my father to see you--that will be better.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not to-morrow,&quot; said Mr. Peter Castlemaine. &quot;I shall be particularly engaged
all day. Some other time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Whenever you please, sir. Only--we must take care that we are not
forestalled in the purchase. Much delay might----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We can obtain a promise of the first refusal,&quot; interrupted the banker, in a
somewhat impatient tone. &quot;That will not be difficult.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;True. Goodnight, sir. And thank you for giving us this most charming
evening.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Goodnight, William.&quot;</p>
<p>But Mr. Blake-Gordon had not yet said his last farewell to his betrothed
wife; and lovers never think <i>that</i> can be spoken often enough. He found
her in the music-room, seated before the organ. She was waiting for her father.</p>
<p>&quot;We shall have Raven's Priory, Mary,&quot; he whispered, speaking in accordance
with his thoughts, in his great hopefulness; and his voice was joyous, and his
pale face had a glow on it not often seen there. &quot;Your papa himself says how
beautiful the gardens and conservatories are.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she softly answered, &quot;we shall be sure to have it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I may not stay, Mary: I only came back to tell you this. And to wish you
goodnight once again.&quot;</p>
<p>Her hand was within his arm, and they walked together to the end of the
music-room. All the lights had been put out, save two. Just within the door he
halted and took his farewell. His arm was around her, his lips were upon hers.</p>
<p>&quot;May all good angels guard you this happy night--my love!--my promised wife!&quot;</p>
<p>He went down the corridor swiftly; she stole her blushing face to the opening
of the door, to take a last look at him. At that moment a crash, as of some
frail thing broken, was heard in the card-room. Mr. Blake-Gordon turned into it
Mary Ursula followed him.</p>
<p>The beautiful Dresden vase lay on the stone flags of the hearth, shivered
into many atoms. It was one that Mary Ursula set great store by, for it had been
a purchase of her mother's.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh papa! How did it happen?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My dear, I swept it off unwittingly with my elbow: I am very sorry for it,&quot;
said Mr. Peter Castlemaine.</p>
<br>

<h4><a name="div1_06" href="#div1Ref_06">CHAPTER VI.</a></h4>
<h5>ANTHONY CASTLEMAINE ON HIS SEARCH.</h5>
<br>

<p>The hour of dinner with all business men in Stilborough was half-past one
o'clock in the day. Perhaps Mr. Peter Castlemaine was the only man who did not
really dine then; but he took his luncheon; which came to the same thing. It was
the recognized daily interregnum in the public doings of the town--this half
hour between half-past one and two: consequently shops, banks, offices, all were
virtually though not actually closed. The bank of Mr. Peter Castlemaine made no
exception. On all days, except Thursday, market day, the bank was left to the
care of one clerk during this half hour: the rest of the clerks and Mr. Hill
would be out at their dinner. As a rule, not a single customer came in until two
o'clock had struck.</p>
<p>It was the day after the ball. The bank had been busy all the morning, and
Mr. Peter Castlemaine had been away the best part of it. He came back at
half-past one, just as the clerks were filing out.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you want me, sir?&quot; asked Thomas Hill, standing back with his hat in his
hand; and it was the dreadfully worn, perplexed look on his master's face that
induced him to ask the question.</p>
<p>&quot;Just for a few minutes,&quot; was the reply. &quot;Come into my room.&quot;</p>
<p>Once there, the door was closed upon them, and they sat in grievous
tribulation. There was no dinner for poor Thomas Hill that day; there was no
lunch for his master: the hour's perplexities were all in all.</p>
<p>On the previous evening some stranger had arrived at Stilborough, had put up
at the chief inn there, the Turk's Head; and then, after enquiring the private
address of Mr. Peter Castlemaine's head clerk, had betaken himself to the
clerk's lodgings. Thomas Hill was seated at tea when the gentleman was shown in.
It proved to be a Mr. Fosbrook, from London: and the moment the clerk heard the
name, Fosbrook, and realized the fact that the owner of it was in actual person
before him, he turned as cold as a stone. For of all the men who could bring
most danger on Mr. Peter Castlemaine, and whom the banker had most cause to
dread, it was this very one, Fosbrook. That he had come down to seek
explanations in person which might no longer be put off, the clerk felt sure of:
and the fact of his seeking out <i>him</i> instead of his master, proved that he
suspected something was more than wrong. He had had a little passing, private
acquaintance with Mr. Fosbrook in the years gone by, and perhaps that induced
the step.</p>
<p>Thomas Hill did what he could. He dared not afford explanation or information
himself, for he knew not what it would be safe to say, what not. He induced Mr.
Fosbrook to return to his inn, undertaking to bring his master to wait on him
there. To the banker's house he would not take the stranger; for the gaiety of
which it was that night the scene was not altogether a pleasant thing to show to
a creditor. Leaving Mr. Fosbrook at the Turk's Head on his way, he came on to
apprise Mr. Peter Castlemaine.</p>
<p>Mr. Peter Castlemaine went at once to the inn. He had no resource but to go:
he did not dare do otherwise: and this it was that caused his absence during the
arrival of the guests. The interview was not a long one; for the banker,
pleading the fact of having friends at home, postponed it until the morning.</p>
<p>It was with this gentleman that his morning had been spent; that he had now,
half-after one o'clock, just come home from. Come home with the weary look in
his face, and the more than weary pain at his heart.</p>
<p>&quot;And what is the result, sir?&quot; asked Thomas Hill as they sat down together.</p>
<p>&quot;The result is, that Fosbrook will wait a few days, Hill three or four, he
says. Perhaps that may be made five or six: I don't know. After that--if he is
not satisfied by tangible proofs that things are right and not wrong, so far as
he is concerned--there will be no further waiting.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And the storm must burst.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The storm must burst,&quot; echoed Peter Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh but, sir, my dear master, what can be done in those few poor days?&quot; cried
Thomas Hill, in agitation. &quot;Nothing. You must have more time allowed you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I had much ado to get that much, Hill. I had to LIE for it,&quot; he added, in a
low tone.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you see a chance yourself, sir?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Only one. There is a chance; but it is a very remote one. That last venture
of mine has turned up trumps: I had the news by the mail this morning: and if I
can realize the funds in time, the present danger may be averted.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And the future trouble also,&quot; spoke Thomas Hill, catching eagerly at the
straw of hope. &quot;Why, sir, that will bring you in a mine of wealth.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. The only real want now is time. Time! time! I have said it before
perhaps too sanguinely; I can say it in all truth now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And, sir--did you not show this to be the case to Mr. Fosbrook?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I did. But alas, I had to deny to him my other pressing liabilities--and he
questioned sharply. Nevertheless, I shall tide it over, all of it, if I can only
secure the time. That account of Merrit's--we may as well go over it together
now, Thomas. It will not take long.&quot;</p>
<p>They drew their chairs to the table side by side. A thought was running
through Thomas Hill's mind, and he spoke it as he opened the ledgers.</p>
<p>&quot;With this good news in store, sir, making repayment certain--for if time be
given you, you will now have plenty--don't you think Mr. Castlemaine would
advance you funds?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; said the banker. &quot;James seems to be growing cautious. He has
no notion of my real position--I shrink from telling him--and I am sure he
thinks that I am quite rich enough without borrowing money from anybody for
fresh speculations. And, in truth, I don't see how he can have much money at
command. This new trouble, that may be looming upon him, will make him extra
cautious.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What trouble?&quot; asked Thomas Hill.</p>
<p>&quot;Some man, I hear, has made his appearance at Greylands, calling himself
Anthony Castlemaine, and saying that he is a son of my brother Basil,&quot; replied
the banker, confidentially.</p>
<p>&quot;Never!&quot; cried the old man. &quot;But, sir, if he be, how should that bring
trouble on Mr. Castlemaine?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because the stranger says he wants to claim Greylands' Rest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He must be out of his mind,&quot; said Thomas Hill. &quot;Greylands' Rest is Mr.
Castlemaine's; safe enough too, I presume.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But a man such as this may give trouble, don't you see.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, sir, I don't see it--with all deference to your opinion. Mr. Castlemaine
has only to show him it is his, and send him to the right about----&quot;</p>
<p>A knock at the room door interrupted the sentence. The clerk rose to open it,
and received a card and a message, which he carried to his master. The banker
looked rather startled as he read the name on it: &quot;Anthony Castlemaine.&quot;</p>
<p>Somewhere about an hour before this, young Anthony Castlemaine, after a late
breakfast a la fourchette, had turned out of the Dolphin Inn to walk to
Stilborough. Repulsed by his Uncle James on the previous day, and not exactly
seeing what his course should be, he had come to the resolution of laying his
case before his other uncle, the banker. Making enquiries of John Bent as to the
position of the banker's residence, he left the inn. Halting for a few seconds
to gaze across beyond the beach, for he thought the sea the most beautiful
object in nature and believed he should never tire of looking at it, he went on
up the hill, past the church, and was fairly on his road to Stilborough. It was
a lonely road enough, never a dwelling to be seen all the way, save a farm
homestead or two lying away amid their buildings; but Anthony Castlemaine walked
slowly, taking in all the points and features of his native land, that were so
strange to his foreign eye. He stood to read the milestones; he leaned on the
fences; he admired the tall fine trees, leafless though they were; he critically
surveyed the two or three carts and waggons that passed. The sky was blue, the
sun bright, he enjoyed the walk and did not hurry himself: but nevertheless he
at length reached Stilborough, and found out the house of the banker. He rang at
the private door.</p>
<p>The servant who opened it saw a young man dressed in a rather uncommon kind
of overcoat, faced with fur. The face was that of a stranger; but the servant
fancied it was a face he had seen before.</p>
<p>&quot;Is my uncle Peter at home?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<i>Sir!</i>&quot; returned the servant, staring at him. For the only nephew the
banker possessed, so far as he knew, was the son of the Master of Greylands.
&quot;What name did you please to ask for, sir?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Peter Castlemaine. This is his residence I am told.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, sir, it is.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can I see him? Is he at home?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He is at home, in his private room, sir; I fancy he is busy. I'll ask if you
can see him. What name shall I say, sir?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You can take my card in. And please say to your master that if he is busy, I
can wait.&quot;</p>
<p>The man glanced at the card as he knocked at the door of the private room,
and read the name: &quot;Anthony Castlemaine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It must be a nephew from over the sea,&quot; he shrewdly thought: &quot;he looks
foreign. Perhaps a son of that lost Basil.&quot;</p>
<p>We have seen that Thomas Hill took in the card and the message to his master.
He came back, saying the gentleman was to wait; Mr. Peter Castlemaine would see
him in a quarter of an hour. So the servant, beguiled by the family name,
thought he should do right to conduct the stranger upstairs to the presence of
Miss Castlemaine, and said so, while helping him to take off his overcoat.</p>
<p>&quot;Shall I say any name, sir?&quot; asked the man, as he laid his hand on the handle
of the drawing-room door.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Anthony Castlemaine.&quot;</p>
<p>Mary Ursula was alone. She sat near the fire doing nothing, and very happy in
her idleness, for her thoughts were buried in the pleasures of the past gay
night; a smile was on her face. When the announcement was made, she rose in
great surprise to confront the visitor. The servant shut the door, and Anthony
came forward.</p>
<p>He did not commit a similar breach of good manners to the one of the previous
day; the results of that had shown him that fair stranger cousins may not be
indiscriminately saluted with kisses in England. He bowed, and held out his hand
with a frank smile. Mary Ursula did not take it: she was utterly puzzled, and
stood gazing at him. The likeness in his face to her father's family struck her
forcibly. It must be premised that she did not yet know anything about Anthony,
or that any such person had made his appearance in England. Anthony waited for
her to speak.</p>
<p>&quot;If I understood the name aright--Anthony Castlemaine--you must be, I
presume, some relative of my late grandfather's, sir?&quot; she said at length.</p>
<p>He introduced himself fully then; who he was, and all about it. Mary Ursula
met his hand cordially. She never doubted him or his identity for a moment. She
had the gift of reading countenances; and she took to the pleasant, honest face
at once, so like the Castlemaines in features, but with a more open expression.</p>
<p>&quot;I am <i>sure</i> you are my cousin,&quot; she said, in cordial welcome. &quot;I think
I should have known you for a Castlemaine had I seen your face in a crowd.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I see, myself, how like I am to the Castlemaines, especially to my father
and grandfather: though unfortunately I have not inherited their height and
strength,&quot; he added, with a slight laugh. &quot;My mother was small and slight: I
take after her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And my poor uncle Basil is dead!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Alas, yes! Only a few weeks ago. These black clothes that I wear are in
memorial of him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I never saw him,&quot; said Miss Castlemaine, gazing at the familiar--for indeed
it seemed familiar--face before her, and tracing out its features. &quot;But I have
heard say my uncle Basil was just the image of his father.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And he was,&quot; said Anthony. &quot;When I saw the picture of my grandfather
yesterday at Greylands' Rest, I thought it was my father's hanging there.&quot;</p>
<p>It was a long while since Miss Castlemaine had met with anyone she liked so
well at a first interview as this young man; and the quarter of an hour passed
quickly. At its end the servant again appeared, saying his master would see him
in his private room. So he took leave of Mary Ursula, and was conducted to it.</p>
<p>But, as it seemed, Mr. Peter Castlemaine did not wait to receive him: for
almost immediately he presented himself before his daughter.</p>
<p>&quot;This person has been with <i>you</i>, I find, Mary Ursula! Very wrong of
Stephen to have brought him up here! I wonder what possessed him to do it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am glad he did bring him, papa,&quot; was her impulsive answer. &quot;You have no
idea what a sensible, pleasant young man he is. I could almost wish he were more
even than a cousin--a brother.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, my dear, you must be dreaming!&quot; cried the banker, after a pause of
astonishment. &quot;Cousin!--brother! It does not do to take strange people on trust
in this way. The man may be, and I dare say is, an adventurer,&quot; he continued,
testily: &quot;no more related to the Castlemaines than I am related to the King of
England.&quot;</p>
<p>She laughed. &quot;You may take <i>him</i> upon trust, papa, without doubt or
fear. He is a Castlemaine all over, save in the height. The likeness to
grandpapa is wonderful; it is so even to you and to uncle James. But he says he
has all needful credential proofs with him.&quot;</p>
<p>The banker, who was then looking from the window, stood fingering the bunch
of seals that hung from his long and massive watch-chain, his habit sometimes
when in deep thought. Self-interest sways us all. The young man was no doubt the
individual he purported to be: but if he were going to put in a vexatious claim
to Greylands' Rest, and so upset James, the banker might get no loan from him.
He turned to his daughter.</p>
<p>&quot;You believe, then, my dear, that he is really what he makes himself out to
be--Basil's son?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Papa, I think there is no question of it. I feel sure there can be none.
Rely upon it, the young man is not one who would lay himself out to deceive, or
to countenance deception: he is evidently honest and open as the day. I scarcely
ever saw so <i>true</i> a face.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I am very sorry,&quot; returned the banker. &quot;It may bring a great deal of
trouble upon James.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In what way can it bring him trouble, papa?&quot; questioned Mary Ursula, in
surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;This young man--as I am informed--has come over to put in a claim to
Greylands' Rest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To Greylands' Rest!&quot; she repeated. &quot;But that is my uncle James's! How can
anyone else claim it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;People may put in a claim to it; there's no law against that; as I fear this
young man means to do,&quot; replied the banker, taking thought and time over his
answer. &quot;He may cost James no end of bother and expense.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But, papa--I think indeed you must be misinformed. I feel sure this young
man is not one who would attempt to claim anything that is not his own.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But if he supposes it to be his own?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What, Greylands' Rest his? How can that be?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My dear child, as yet I know almost nothing. Nothing but a few words that
Mrs. Castlemaine said to me last night.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But why should he take up such a notion, papa?&quot; she asked, in surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;From his father, I suppose. I know Basil as much believed Greylands' Rest
would descend to him as he believed In his Bible. However, I must go down and
see this young man.&quot;</p>
<p>As soon as Peter Castlemaine entered his private room, and let his eyes rest
on the face of the young man who met him so frankly, he saw the great likeness
to the Castlemaines. That it was really his nephew, Basil's son, he had
entertained little doubt of from the first; none, since the recent short
interview with his daughter. With this conviction on his mind, it never would
have occurred to him to deny or cast doubts on the young man's identity, and he
accepted it at once. But though he called him &quot;Anthony,&quot; or &quot;Anthony
Castlemaine&quot;--and now and then by mistake &quot;Basil&quot;--he did not show any mark of
gratification or affection, but was distant and cold; and thought it very
inconvenient and ill-judged of Basil's son to be bringing trouble on James.
Taking his place in his handsome chair, turned sideways to the closed desk, he
faced the young man seated before him.</p>
<p>A few minutes were naturally spent in questions and answers, chiefly as to
Basil's career abroad. Young Anthony gave every information freely--just as he
had done to his uncle James on the previous day. After that, at the first pause,
he passed on to the subject of the inheritance.</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps, Uncle Peter, you will not refuse to give me some information about
my grandfather's estate, Greylands' Rest,&quot; he began. &quot;My father always assured
me it would be mine. He said it would come to him at his father's death, and
then to me afterwards----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He must have spoken without justifiable warranty,&quot; interrupted the banker.
&quot;It did not necessarily lapse to Basil, or to anyone else. Your grandfather
could leave it to whom he would.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course: we never understood otherwise. But my father always said that it
would never be left away from him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then I say, that he spoke without sufficient warranty,&quot; repeated the banker.
&quot;Am I to understand that you have come over to this country to put in a claim to
Greylands' Rest, on this sole justification?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My father, on his dying bed, charged me to come and claim it, Uncle Peter.
He had bequeathed it to me in his will. It was only quite at the last that he
learnt his father was dead, and he made a fresh will at once, and gave me the
charge to come over without delay. When I presented myself to my uncle James
yesterday, he seemed much to resent the fact that I should put in any claim to
the estate. He told me I had no right to do so; he said it was his.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well?&quot; said the banker; for the young man had paused.</p>
<p>&quot;Uncle Peter, I am not unreasonable. I come home to find my uncle James in
possession of the estate, and quite ready, as I gather, to oppose my claim to
it; or, I should better say, to treat me and my claim with contempt. Now I do
not forget that my grandfather <i>might</i> have left it to uncle James; that he
had the power to do so----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Most undoubtedly he had,&quot; again interrupted the banker. &quot;And I can tell you
that he never, to the very last, allowed anybody to interfere with his wish and
will.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I say I am not unreasonable, Uncle Peter. Though I have come over to
claim the estate, I should not attempt to lay claim to it in the teeth of facts.
I told my uncle James so. Once let me be convinced that the estate was really
and fairly bequeathed to him, and I would not, for the world, wish to disturb
him in its possession. I am not a rogue.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But he is in possession, Anthony; and it appears that you do wish to disturb
him,&quot; remonstrated Mr. Peter Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;I beg your pardon; I think you have not quite caught my meaning. What I want
is, to be assured that Greylands' Rest was left away from my father: that he was
passed over for my uncle James. If uncle James came into it by will, or by legal
deed, of any kind, let him just <i>show</i> me the deed or the will, and that
will suffice.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You doubt his word then!&quot;</p>
<p>Young Anthony hesitated, before replying; and then spoke out with ingenuous
candour.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact is, Uncle Peter, I deem it <i>right</i> to assure myself by proof,
of how the matter is; for my father warned me that there might be treachery----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Treachery!&quot; came the quick, echoing interposition of the banker; his dark
eyes flashing fire.</p>
<p>&quot;My father thought it possible,&quot; quietly continued the young man; &quot;he feared
that, even though Greylands' Rest was legally mine, my claim to it might be
opposed. That is one reason why I press for proof; I should press for it if
there existed no other. But I find that doubts already are circulating abroad as
to how Mr. James Castlemaine came into the estate, and whether it became
lawfully his on my grandfather's death.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Doubts existing abroad! Doubts where?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Amid the neighbours, the people of Greyland's. I have heard one and another
talk of it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, indeed!&quot; was the cold rejoinder. &quot;Pray where are you staying?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;At the Dolphin Inn, Uncle Peter. When I descended at it, and saw the flaming
dolphin on the signboard, splashing up the water, I could not help smiling; for
my father had described it to me so accurately, that it seemed like an old
acquaintance.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Peter Castlemaine made no rejoinder, and there ensued a silence. In
truth, his own difficulties were so weighty that they had been pressing on his
mind throughout, an undercurrent of trouble, and for the moment he was lost in
them.</p>
<p>&quot;Will <i>you</i>, Uncle Peter, give me some information of the true state of
the case?&quot; resumed the young man. &quot;I came here purposely, intending to ask you.
You see, I want to be placed at a certainty, one way or the other. I again
repeat that I am not unreasonable; I only ask to be dealt with fairly and
honourably. If Greylands' Rest is not mine, show me that it is not; if it is
mine, I ought to have it. Perhaps you will tell me, Uncle Peter, how it was
left.&quot;</p>
<p>The banker suddenly let drop his seals, with which he had been playing during
the last appeal, and turned his full attention to the speaker, answering in a
more frank tone than he had yet spoken.</p>
<p>&quot;When your father, Basil, went away, he took his full portion of money with
him--a third of the money we should conjointly inherit. I received my portion
later; James received his. Nothing remained but Greylands' Rest and the
annuity--a large one--which your grandfather enjoyed from his wife's family:
which annuity had nothing to do with us, for it would go back again at his
death. Greylands' Rest could be disposed of as he should please. Does it strike
you as any strange thing, Anthony, that he should prefer its passing to the son
who was always with him, rather than to the son who had abandoned him and his
home, and whom he did not even know to be alive?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uncle Peter, I have said that I see reasons why my grandfather might make
his second son his heir, rather than his eldest. If he did so, I am quite ready
and willing to accept the fact, but I must first of all be convinced that it is
fact. It is true, is it not, that my grandfather always intended to leave the
estate to his eldest son Basil?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That is true,&quot; assented the banker, readily. &quot;Such no doubt was his
intention at one time. But Basil crossed him, and went, besides, out of sight
and out of mind, and James remained with him and was always a dutiful son. It
was much more natural that he should bequeath it to James than to Basil.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, will you give me the particulars of the bequest, Uncle Peter? Was the
estate devised by will, or by deed of gift?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I decline to give you more particulars than I have already given,&quot; was the
prompt reply of the banker. &quot;The affair is not mine; it is my brother James's.
You find him in secure possession of the estate; you are told that it is his;
and that ought to suffice. It is a very presumptuous proceeding on the part of
Basil's son, to come over in this extraordinary manner, without warning of any
kind, and attempt to question the existing state of things. That is my opinion,
Anthony.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is this your final resolve, Uncle Peter?--not to help me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My final, irrevocable resolve. I have enough to do in attending to my own
affairs, without interfering with my brother's!&quot;</p>
<p>Anthony Castlemaine took up his hat, and put forth his hand. &quot;I am very
sorry, Uncle Peter. It might have saved so much trouble. Perhaps I shall have to
go to law.&quot;</p>
<p>The banker shook hands with him in a sufficiently friendly spirit: but he did
not ask him to remain, or to call again.</p>
<p>&quot;One hint I will give you, Anthony,&quot; he said, as the young man turned to the
door; and he spoke apparently upon impulse. &quot;Were you to expend your best years
and your best energies upon this search, you would be no wiser than you are now.
The Castlemaines do not brook interference; neither are their affairs conducted
in that loose manner that can afford a possibility of their being inquired into;
and so long as Mr. Castlemaine refuses to allow you ocular proof, rely upon it
you will never get to have it. The Castlemaines know how to hold their own.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am a Castlemaine, too, uncle, and can hold my own with the best of them.
Nothing will turn me from my course in this matter, save the proofs I have asked
for.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good-morning, Anthony.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good-day, Uncle Peter.&quot;</p>
<p>Anthony put on his coat in the hall, and went forth into the street. There he
halted; looking this way and that way, as though uncertain of his route.</p>
<p>&quot;A few doors on the right hand, on the other side the market-house, John Bent
said,&quot; he repeated to himself. &quot;Then I must cross the street, and so onwards.&quot;</p>
<p>He crossed over, went on past the market-house, and looked attentively at the
doors on the other side it. On one of those doors was a brass plate: &quot;Mr.
Knivett, Attorney-at-law.&quot; Anthony Castlemaine rang the bell, asked if the
lawyer was at home, and sent in one of his cards.</p>
<p>He was shown into a small back room. At a table strewn with papers and pens,
sat an elderly man with a bald head, who was evidently regarding the card with
the utmost astonishment. He turned his spectacles on Anthony.</p>
<p>&quot;Do I see Mr. Knivett, the avou?&quot; he asked, substituting for once a French
term for an English one, perhaps unconsciously.</p>
<p>&quot;I am Mr. Knivett, sir, attorney-at-law.&quot;</p>
<p>In the frank, free way that seemed so especially to characterise him, Anthony
Castlemaine put out his hand as to a friend.</p>
<p>&quot;You knew my father well, sir. Will you receive his son for old memories'
sake?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your father?&quot; asked Mr. Knivett, questioningly: but nevertheless meeting the
hand with his own, and glancing again at the card.</p>
<p>&quot;Basil Castlemaine. He who went away so long ago from Greylands' Rest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bless my heart!&quot; cried Mr. Knivett, snatching off his glasses in his
surprise. &quot;Basil Castlemaine! I never thought to hear of him again. Why, it must
be--ay--since he left, it mast be hard upon five-and-thirty years.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;About that, I suppose, sir.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And--is he come back?&quot;</p>
<p>Anthony had again to go over the old story. His father's doings abroad and
his father's death, and his father's charge to him to come home and claim his
paternal inheritance: he rehearsed it all. Mr. Knivett, who was very
considerably past sixty, and had put his spectacles on again, never ceased
gazing at the relator, as they sat nearly knee to knee. Not for a moment did any
doubt occur to him that the young man was other than he represented himself to
be: the face was the face of a Castlemaine, and of a truthful gentleman.</p>
<p>&quot;But I have come to you, not only to show myself to a friend of my poor
father's in his youth, but also as a client,&quot; proceeded Anthony, after a short
while. &quot;I have need of a lawyer's advice, sir; which I am prepared to pay for
according to the charges of the English country. Will you advise me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To be sure,&quot; replied Mr. Knivett. &quot;What advice is it that you want?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;First of all, sir--In the days when my father was at home, you were the
solicitor to my grandfather, old Anthony Castlemaine. Did you continue to be so
until his death?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I did.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then you can, I hope, give me some particulars that I desire to know. To
whom was Greylands' Rest bequeathed--and in what manner was it devised?&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Knivett shook his head. &quot;I cannot give you any information upon the
point,&quot; he said. &quot;I must refer you to Mr. Castlemaine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have applied to Mr. Castlemaine, and to Mr. Peter Castlemaine also:
neither of them will tell me anything. They met me with a point blank refusal to
do so.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah--I daresay. The Castlemaines never choose to be questioned.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why will not you afford me the information, Mr. Knivett?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;For two reasons. Firstly, because the probability is that--pray understand
me, young sir; note what I say--the probability is that I do not possess the
information to give you. Secondly, if I did possess it, my relations with the
family would preclude my imparting it. I am the attorney to the Castlemaines.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Their confidential attorney?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Some of the business I transact for them is confidential.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But see here, Mr. Knivett--what am I to do? I come over at the solemn
command of my father, delivered to me on his death-bed, to put in my claim to
the estate. I find my uncle James in possession of it. He says it is his. Well
and good: I do not say it is quite unlikely to be so. But when I say to him,
'Show me the vouchers for it, the deed or the will that you hold it by,' he
shuts himself metaphorically up, and says he will not show me anything--that I
must be satisfied with his word. Now, is that satisfactory?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I daresay it does not appear so to you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If there was a will made, let them allow me to see the will; if it was
bequeathed by a deed of gift, let me read the deed of gift. Can there be
anything more fair than what I ask? If Greylands' Rest is legally my uncle
James's, I should not be so foolish or so unjust as to wish to deprive him of
it.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Knivett sat back in his chair, pressing the tips of his fingers together,
and politely listening. But comment made he none.</p>
<p>&quot;To go back home, without prosecuting my claim, is what I shall never do,
unless I am convinced that I have no claim to prosecute,&quot; continued Anthony.
&quot;Well, sir, I shall want a legal gentleman to advise me how to set about the
investigation of the affair; and hence I come to you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have shown you why I cannot advise you,&quot; said Mr. Knivett--and his manner
was ever so many shades colder than it had been at first. &quot;I am the attorney to
Mr. Castlemaine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You cannot help me at all, then?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not at all; in this.&quot;</p>
<p>It sounded rather hard to the young man as he rose from his seat to depart.
All he wanted was fair play, open dealing; and it seemed that he could not get
it.</p>
<p>&quot;My uncle Peter, with whom I have just been, said a thing that I did not
like,&quot; he stayed to remark; &quot;it rather startled me. I presume--I should
think--that he is a man of strict veracity?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Peter Castlemaine? Undoubtedly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, sir, what he said was this. That were I to spend my best years and
energies in the search after information, I should be no wiser at the end than I
am now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That I believe to be extremely probable,&quot; cordially assented the lawyer.</p>
<p>&quot;But do you see the position in which it would leave me? Years and
years!--and I am not to be satisfied one way or the other?&quot;</p>
<p>The attorney froze again. &quot;Ah, yes; true.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, sir, I will say good-day to you, for it seems that I can do no good by
staying, and I must not take up your time for nothing. I only wish you had been
at liberty to advise me.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Knivett made some civil rejoinder about wishing that he had been. So they
parted, and the young man found himself in the street again. Until now it had
been one of the brightest of days; but during this short interview at the
lawyer's, the weather seemed to have changed. The skies, as Anthony Castlemaine
looked up, were now dull and threatening. The clouds had lowered. He buttoned
his warm coat about him, and began his walk back to Greylands.</p>
<p>&quot;Je crois que nous aurons de la neige,&quot; he said, in the familiar language to
which he was most accustomed, &quot;et je n'ai pas de parapluie. N'importe; je
marcherai vite.&quot;</p>
<p>Walk fast! And to Greylands! Could poor Anthony Castlemaine have foreseen the
black pall of Fate, already closing upon him like a dreadful shadow, he had
turned his steps away from Greylands for ever.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h4><a name="div1_07" href="#div1Ref_07">CHAPTER VII.</a></h4>
<h5>IN THE MOONLIGHT.</h5>
<br>

<p>White clouds were passing over the face of the blue sky, casting their light
and their shade on the glorious sea. Not for a minute together did the sea
present the same surface; its hue, its motions, and its ripples were for ever
changing. Now it would be blue and clear almost as crystal; anon, green and
still; next, sparkling like diamonds under the sunlight: and each aspect seemed
more beautiful than that which it had displaced.</p>
<p>To Anthony Castlemaine, gazing at it from his bedroom at the Dolphin Inn, no
object in nature had ever seemed so beautiful. Not the vineyards of his native
land; not the sunny plains of Italy; not the grand picturesque mountains of
Switzerland: all these he had been accustomed to from his youth, and they were
fair to look upon: but to him they were as nothing, compared with this wide,
wondrous, ever-changing sea.</p>
<p>Some days, a very few, had elapsed since his visit to Stilborough, told of in
the last chapter. Another week had come in, and this was the Tuesday in it:
destined to be a most fatal day for more than one person connected with our
story. The snow-storm he had anticipated, in his homeward walk that afternoon,
had passed off without falling; the cold itself seemed on the next day to have
taken its departure. With that variable caprice that distinguishes our insular
climate, the biting frost, the keen east wind, that had almost cut people
through, had given, place to the warm, cheering weather of a balmy spring.</p>
<p>Anthony Castlemaine had opened the casement window to admit the genial air,
the fresh sea-breeze, and stood there in profound thought. On the table lay a
letter he had just written. Its seal of black wax was stamped with the
Castlemaine crest, and it was addressed to his native place, Gap, Dauphin. Some
shouting arose on the beach, drawing his attention. A fishing-boat was preparing
to put out; one of her men had not come down, and the two others and the shrill
boy were raising their voices to make tie laggard hear. He went dashing out of
the Dolphin Inn, just under the view of Anthony.</p>
<p>Anthony Castlemaine was in perplexity. He did not see his way any clearer
before him than he had seen it when he first came. That Greylands' Rest was
legally his he entertained no doubt of; but to prove it was another matter. He
and Mr. Castlemaine had met one day near the Dolphin; they had talked for a few
minutes, but Anthony could make out nothing. Twice since then he had presented
himself at Greylands Rest, and Mr. Castlemaine had been denied to him. It was
quite evident he meant to have nothing more to do with Anthony.</p>
<p>The waves of the sea sparkled and rippled; the sun came out from behind a
fleecy cloud, and shone with renewed strength; a beautiful vessel in the
distance was passing with all her sails set.</p>
<p>&quot;It is very strange behaviour,&quot; mused Anthony. &quot;If the estate belongs in
truth to my uncle James, why can he not show me that it does? His <i>not</i>
showing it almost proves of itself that it is mine. I <i>must</i> get to see
him: I cannot stay in the dark like this.&quot;</p>
<p>Taking up the letter, he descended the stairs, went across to the little
general shop near the beach, and dropped it into the letter-box. He was quite at
home in Greylands now, had made acquaintance with its inhabitants, and was known
and recognised as the grandson of old Anthony Castlemaine. In returning he met
one of the Grey Sisters. Lifting his hat, he bowed to her with deep respect; for
he regarded the Grey Ladies as a religious order, and in his native land these
female communities are held in reverence. Little Sister Phoeby--she was very
short and stout, and nearly middle-aged, and only one of the working
sisters--bobbed down her grey head in return, giving him a kindly good-morrow.</p>
<p>&quot;And John Bent thinks that Mr. Castlemaine derides these good ladies!&quot;
thought Anthony. &quot;It must be fancy. John has fancies. He---- Dear me! here's
that charming demoiselle again!&quot;</p>
<p>She was advancing swiftly, seemingly wishing to catch Sister Phoeby, her
pretty figure attired becomingly in a light silk dress and short scarlet cloak
with silken tassels; her strangely-beautiful eyes were cast on the sea with the
same look of loving admiration that Anthony's own sometimes wore when gazing at
it. He could have wished that this young lady was his sister, or really his
cousin: for Anthony had not seen many faces in his life that he so believed in
for truth and goodness and beauty as Ethel Reene's.</p>
<p>They had nearly met before she observed him. He stopped and addressed some
words to her in deprecation of his former fault, keeping his hat off while he
spoke. Ethel answered him frankly, and held out her hand. Since the previous
encounter, she had had time to digest the offence, to understand how it had
arisen and that he had not the least intention of insulting her; she had also
been favourably impressed with what she had heard abroad of Anthony Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;Let us forget it,&quot; said Ethel, with her sweet smile. &quot;I understand now how
it happened; I know you did not intend any offence. Are you going to make a long
stay at the Dolphin?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That must depend partly on Mr. Castlemaine,&quot; replied Anthony. &quot;He will not
give me an interview, and for myself I can scarcely see a step before my face. I
must ask him once more to listen to me; I hope he will. I had some thought of
going to him this afternoon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He is at home,&quot; said Ethel, innocently, who only very imperfectly understood
the trouble looming between the young man before her and Mr. Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;At home now? Then I will go to him at once,&quot; said he, acting on the impulse
of the moment: and he again offered his hand to Ethel. &quot;Adieu. I hope you have
quite forgiven me, Miss Castlemaine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have quite forgiven you, indeed: but I am not Miss Castlemaine, you know,&quot;
she said, laughing, as she let her hand rest in his. &quot;You will know my name
better soon--Ethel Reene. Good-bye.&quot;</p>
<p>And during her after-life Ethel was wont to look back often on this little
meeting, and to feel thankful that it had taken place, and that it was a
pleasant one. For she never again saw the ill-fated young man in this world.</p>
<p>Recrossing the road, and passing the inn corner, Anthony got into the fields
on his way to Greylands' Rest. They were pleasanter than the road that sunshiny
afternoon. He walked along in deep thought, deliberating on what he should say.</p>
<p>Ah, if he could but have seen behind him! A double shadow followed him--as
the poet Hood wrote of Miss Kilmansegg going upstairs to her doom. His own
natural shadow and another. Nearer and nearer it had been gradually drawing as
the days went on; and now on this day it lay ready to close on him--as it would
close ere the clock had told many more hours: the dark, dreadful, ominous shadow
of death. Of a death done in darkness and secret.</p>
<p>In the last field, side by side with the avenue that led to Greylands' Rest,
while Anthony was wondering whether he should be permitted to see his uncle or
not, his uncle suddenly stood in front of him, coming through the little gateway
that led into the field.</p>
<p>The Master of Greylands, erect, well dressed, handsome, would have passed him
with a slight nod, but Anthony put himself in his way.</p>
<p>&quot;Uncle James, I beg your pardon; I would not wish to be rude; but will you
allow me to speak a few little words to you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am in a hurry,&quot; said Mr. Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;Will you give me then a short interview at your house this evening? Or
to-morrow morning, if that will suit you better.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; replied Mr. Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;Twice I have been to Greylands' Rest, asking to see you, Uncle James; and
twice have I been denied. Though the last time I think you were at home, and
that you saw me from the window.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You cannot have anything to say to me that I wish to hear, or that would be
profitable to yourself,&quot; returned the Master of Greylands &quot;for that reason I was
denied to you. Our first interview was not so satisfactory that we need wish for
another.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But it is necessary that we should converse,&quot; returned the young man. &quot;I am
waiting to have this question settled as to Greylands' Rest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What question?&quot; demanded Mr. Castlemaine, with haughty indifference--just as
though he had quite forgotten that anything had ever arisen in regard to it.</p>
<p>&quot;Greylands' Rest is yours, Uncle James, or it is mine: I must ascertain which
of us it belongs to. You decline to tell me----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Decline to tell you,&quot; interrupted Mr. Castlemaine. &quot;Cannot you use your own
eyes and your judgment, and see that it is mine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I see that you are in possession of it, Uncle James; I see no farther. You
decline to show me anything of the facts: my Uncle Peter declines; Knivett, the
attorney-at-law, declines.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Have you applied to Knivett?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, last week.&quot;</p>
<p>The eyes of Mr. Castlemaine flashed fire. &quot;How dare you do such a thing, sir,
as attempt to interfere in my affairs? Tamper with my man of business! By
heaven, I have a great mind to give you into custody!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do not let us quarrel, Uncle James; suffer me to say what little I have to
say quietly. I did not go to Mr. Knivett otherwise than openly. He said he could
tell me nothing; and I recognized the weight of his objection--that he is your
attorney. Being so, he of course cannot act for me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps you tried to bribe him to act for you,&quot; scoffed Mr. Castlemaine, who
was foolishly beginning to lose his temper.</p>
<p>&quot;I would not do any mean or dishonourable thing, Uncle James; I am a
Castlemaine, and my father's son. But what I have to say to you is this, that
matters cannot rest as they are: and I wish you fully to understand what my
course will be if you do not give me the satisfaction I require, as to who is
the true owner of Greylands' Rest. Only show me that it is yours, and I make my
bow of departure from Greylands.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are pretty insolent for a young man!&quot; retorted Mr. Castlemaine, looking
down on him with scorn. &quot;Do you suppose such an application was ever made to a
gentleman before? You speak of your father, my brother Basil: had some impudent
stranger presented himself before him, and demanded to see title-deeds of his,
what would his answer have been, think you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Circumstances alter cases, Uncle James. My case is different from the
imaginary one that you put. Only satisfy me that the place is yours, and I ask
no more. I have a right to know so much.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You never shall know it: for your insolence, you shall never know more than
you know now. Do your best and worst.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then you will leave me no resource but to proceed,&quot; returned the young man,
who maintained his temper and his courtesy in a notable degree. &quot;I shall employ
the best lawyer I can call to my aid, and act on his advice.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tush!&quot; was the contemptuous answer. &quot;Go and put in a claim to Parson
Marston's church--to the Dolphin Inn,--to the beach itself! Claim all, and see
how far a lawyer will advance you in it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wish you had met me temperately, Uncle James. I only ask what's fair--to
be satisfied. It is the talk of the neighbours now: they say you ought to
satisfy me; they think you would do it if it were in your power.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; roared Mr. Castlemaine.</p>
<p>Had Anthony seen the storm he was provoking, he had surely not continued. He
did not wish to irritate Mr. Castlemaine: all he wanted was to show him the
reasons of his proposed attempted investigation--to prove to him that he was
justified in what he meant to do. The truth was, the young man, who was by
nature just, honourable, and kindly, who had never in his life attempted to take
a mean advantage of friend or enemy, felt half ashamed and deeply grieved to be
thus thrown into adverse contact with his newly-found relatives; and he sought
to show that he had justifiable excuse for it.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not my fault, uncle, if the people thus give their opinion: I did not
ask for it, or provoke them to it. What they say has reason in it, as it seems
to me. When the popular belief prevailed that my grandfather would not leave his
estate away from his eldest son, Basil, and when it was never known how he did
leave it, or to whom, or anything about it, save that his second son remained in
possession, why, they talked. That is what I am told. It would be a satisfaction
to the public as well as to me, Uncle James, if you would suffer the truth to be
known.&quot;</p>
<p>It was not often that the Master of Greylands allowed anger to overpower him.
In his younger days he had been subject to fits of intemperate passion, but time
and self-control had well-nigh stamped the failing out. Perhaps until this
moment he had believed it had left him for ever. His passion rose now: his face
was scarlet; his clenched hands were kept by force down to his side, lest they
should deal a blow at Anthony. <i>Them</i>, so far, he controlled, but not his
tongue: and he poured forth a torrent of abuse.</p>
<p>&quot;Go back to where you came from, insolent, upstart braggart!&quot; were the words
he finished up with. &quot;You are no true son of my brother Basil. Ill-doing though
he was, he was not a fire-brand, striving to spread malignant dissension amid a
peaceable community.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uncle James, I shall never go back until I have come to the bottom of this
matter,&quot; spoke the young man, firmly: and it may be that his unruffled temper,
his very calmness of bearing, only served to irritate all the more Mr.
Castlemaine. &quot;The best man of law that London will afford I shall summon to my
aid: he must force you to show the title by which you hold possession of the
estate; and we shall then see which has the most right to it, you or I.&quot;</p>
<p>The words inflamed Mr. Castlemaine almost to madness. With a fierce oath--and
bad language, though common enough then, was what he was rarely, if ever,
betrayed to use--he lifted his hand to strike. Anthony, startled, got away.</p>
<p>&quot;What have I done to merit this treatment, Uncle James?&quot; he remonstrated. &quot;Is
it because I am a relative? You would not, for shame, so treat a stranger.&quot;</p>
<p>But the Master of Greylands, flinging back a word and look of utter contempt,
went striding on his way, leaving his nephew alone.</p>
<p>Now it happened that this contest was witnessed by the superintendent of the
coastguard, Mr. Nettleby, who was walking along the path of the neighbouring
field behind the far-off intervening hedge, bare at that season. He could not
hear the words that passed--the whole field was between--but he saw they were
angry ones, and that the Master of Greylands was in a foaming passion. Calling
in at the Dolphin Inn, he related before one or two people what he had seen: and
Anthony, when he returned soon after, gave the history of the interview.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sure I thought Mr. Castlemaine struck you, sir,&quot; resumed the officer.</p>
<p>&quot;No, but he would have liked to strike me,&quot; said Anthony. &quot;I stepped back
from his hand. It is very foolish of him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think he would like to kill Mr. Anthony, for my part, by the way he treats
him,&quot; said John Bent. But the words were only spoken in the heat of
partisanship, without actual meaning: just as we are all given to hasty
assertions on occasion. However, they were destined to be remembered afterwards
by Greylands.</p>
<p>Somewhat later John Bent and his guest were standing at the front door,
talking together of the general perplexity of things. The sun was setting in the
west in beautiful clouds of rose-colour and amber, showing the advance of
evening John began to think he had better be laying the cloth for the parlour
dinner, unless he wanted his wife about him. And--here she was! her
cherry-coloured ribbons right over his shoulder.</p>
<p>At that moment, careering down the road from Greylands' Rest, came Harry
Castlemaine on his spirited horse. His overcoat was rolled up and strapped on
the saddle, and he looked as though mounted for a journey. On the road he was
bent the Chapel Lane would have been the nearest way; but when on horseback
Harry always took the front way from his house, though it might involve a round
through the village.</p>
<p>&quot;Going out a pleasuring, Mr. Harry?&quot; cried the landlady, as he reined-in.</p>
<p>&quot;Going out a businessing,&quot; corrected the young man, in his free and careless
manner, as he nodded and smiled at Anthony--for he did not share in his father's
discourteous behaviour to their new relative, though he had not yet made
advances to any intimacy. &quot;A beautiful sunset, is it not?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Quite very beautiful,&quot; replied Anthony.</p>
<p>&quot;I am bound for Newerton, Mrs. Bent,&quot; resumed Harry. &quot;Can I do anything for
you there?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing, thank you, sir.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What, not even choose you some cap ribbons? Newerton ribbons, you know, take
the conceit out of those at Stilborough.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You must always have your joke, Mr. Harry! As if a fine young gentleman like
you would trouble himself to choose an old woman's ribbons!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;See if I don't bring you some! Meanwhile, John, suppose you give me a glass
of ale, to speed me on my journey.&quot;</p>
<p>The landlord brought the ale, handing it up on a waiter; somewhat to his own
discomfort, for the horse was prancing and rearing. Harry Castlemaine drank it;
and with a general nod, an intimation that he should return on the morrow, and a
wave of the hand to his cousin, he rode away.</p>
<p>Anthony went round the corner of the house to look after him. Not being
anything great in horsemanship himself, he admired those who were. He admired
also the tall, fine form, the handsome face, and the free, frank bearing of
Harry Castlemaine; and a hope in that moment arose in his heart that they might
become good friends if he remained in England. He stood and watched him up the
road until its bending hid him from view. Harry's route lay past the Grey
Nunnery, past the coastguard station higher up, and so onwards. Newerton was a
town of some importance, at about ten miles distance.</p>
<p>The remaining events of the evening, so far as they concerned Anthony
Castlemaine, were destined to assume importance and to be discussed for days and
weeks afterwards. He took his dinner at six, John Bent waiting on him as usual;
afterwards, he sat alone for an hour or two in deep thought. At least, Mrs.
Bent, coming in to take away his coffee-cup, assumed him to be deep in thought
as he did not speak to her, an unusual thing. He sat between the table and the
fire, his elbow resting on the former and his fingers pressing his right temple.
The landlady had never seen him so still, or look so solemn; there was a cloud
as of some dread care upon his face--she declared so to the world afterwards.
Could it have been that in those, the last few hours of his life on earth, a
foreshadowing of the dreadful fate about to overtake him was presented in some
vague manner to his mind? It might have been so.</p>
<p>About nine o'clock he suddenly asked the landlord to fetch down his inkstand
and paper-case, which he had left in his bedroom; and then he wrote a letter,
sealed it as he had the one in the afternoon, and put on it the same address.
By-and-by, John Bent came in again to look to the fire.</p>
<p>&quot;I have made up my mind to get another interview with Mr. Castlemaine before
I apply for legal advice,&quot; spoke Anthony.</p>
<p>&quot;Bless me!&quot; exclaimed John Bent, for the words surprised him.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. I have been thinking it well over from beginning to end; and I see that
I ought to give my uncle James one more opportunity to settle it amicably,
before bringing the dispute openly before the world, and causing a scandal. He
was in a passion this afternoon and perhaps did not quite understand me: when he
shall have had time to reflect he may be more reasonable.&quot;</p>
<p>John Bent shook his head. In his own mind he did not believe that fifty fresh
appeals would have any effect on Mr. Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;I say this to myself,&quot; went on Anthony: &quot;Whether Greylands' Rest is his by
right or not, he is in possession of it. Nobody can deny that. And I have tried
to put myself in imagination in his place, and I see how cruel a blow it would
seem if a stranger came to seek to deprive me of it. I might be as angry as he
is.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then, sir, do you intend to leave him in possession of it?&quot; returned the
landlord.</p>
<p>&quot;No, no; you do not comprehend. I must enforce my claim; if the estate is
mine, I will never yield it--to him, or to anyone. But it may be his: and I
think it is only just to offer him one more opportunity of privately satisfying
me, before I take any proceedings. I shall do so. If I cannot see him to-morrow,
I will write to him fully.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The meeting might only lead to another quarrel, Mr. Anthony.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well--yes--I have thought of that. And I fear he would injure me if he
could,&quot; added the young man, in a dreamy manner, and speaking to himself instead
of to his landlord. &quot;There: don't put more coal, please: it is too warm.&quot;</p>
<p>John Bent went away with his coal-scuttle. He remarked to his wife that their
inmate did not seem in his usual good spirits. Mrs. Bent, trimming one of her
smart caps at the round table by the fire, answered that she knew as much as
that without being told; and that he (John) had better see that Molly was
properly attending to the company in the public-room.</p>
<p>It was considerably past ten, and the company--as Mrs. Bent called them,
which consisted principally of fishermen--were singing a jovial song, when
Anthony Castlemaine came out of his parlour, the letter in his hand. Just as he
had posted the one written in the afternoon, so he went over to the box now and
posted this. After that, he took a turn up and down the beach, listening to the
low murmuring of the sea, watching the moonbeams as they played on the water. It
was a most beautiful night; the air still and warm, the moon rather remarkably
bright. That Greylands' Rest was his own legally now, and would soon be his own
practically, he entertained no doubt, and he lost himself in visions of the
pleasant life he might lead there. Thus the time slipped unconsciously on, and
when he got back to the Dolphin the clock had struck eleven. John Bent's company
were taking their departure--for the house closed at the sober hour of
eleven--John's man was shutting the shutters, and John himself stood outside his
door, his hat on his head and a pipe in his mouth.</p>
<p>&quot;A lovely night, sir, isn't it?&quot; he began. &quot;A'most like summer. I've been
finishing my pipe outside on the bench here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lovely indeed,&quot; replied Anthony. &quot;I could never tire of looking at the sea
yonder.&quot;</p>
<p>They paced about together before the bench, talking, and presently extending
their stroll up the hill. Mr. Nettleby's residence, a fair-sized, pretty
cottage, stood aback from the road in its garden, just opposite the Grey
Nunnery; and Mr. Nettleby, smoking his pipe, was at the outer gate.</p>
<p>When that fatal night was gone and past, and people began to recall its
events, they said how chance trifles seemed to have worked together to bring
about the ill. Had Anthony Castlemaine not written that letter, the probability
was that he would never have gone out at all; on returning from the post and the
beach, had the landlord not been outside the inn, he would at once have entered:
and finally, had the superintendent of the coastguard not been at his gate, they
would not have stayed abroad.</p>
<p>Mr. Nettleby invited them in, hospitably offering them a pipe and glass. He
had business abroad that night, and therefore had not retired to rest. They
consented to enter, &quot;just for a minute.&quot;</p>
<p>The minute extended itself to the best part of an hour. Once seated there by
the fire, and plunged into a sea of talk, they were in no hurry to move again.
Anthony Castlemaine accepted a pipe, John Bent refilled his. The former took a
glass of sugar and water--at which Mr. Nettleby made a wry face; John Bent had a
glass of weak Hollands, which lasted him during the visit: he was no drinker.</p>
<p>The conversation turned on various matters. On the claims of Anthony to
Greylands' Rest, which had become quite a popular topic; on the social politics
of Greylands, and on other subjects. Under a strong injunction of secrecy, Mr.
Nettleby imparted certain suspicions that he was entertaining of a small hamlet
called Beeton, a mile or two higher up the coast. He believed some extensive
smuggling was carried on there, and he purposed paying a visit to the place that
very night, to look out for anything there might be to see. Anthony inquired
whether he was extensively troubled by smugglers, and the superintendent said
No; very little indeed, considering that the coast lay so convenient for Holland
and other suspicious countries: but he had his doubts.</p>
<p>They all went out together. It was twelve o'clock, or close upon it. Mr.
Nettleby's road lay to the left; theirs to the right. However, they turned to
accompany him a short distance, seduced to it by the beauty of the night.</p>
<p>&quot;In for a penny, in for a pound,&quot; thought John Bent. &quot;The missis can't go on
more if I stay out for another hour than she'll go on now.&quot;</p>
<p>But they did not walk far: just to the top of the hill, and a short way
beyond it. They then wished the officer goodnight, and turned back again.</p>
<p>The Friar's Keep looked ghastly enough in the moonlight. Anthony Castlemaine
glanced up at its roof, dilapidated in places, at its dark casement windows.
&quot;Let us watch a minute,&quot; said he, jestingly, &quot;perhaps the Grey Monk will
appear.&quot;</p>
<p>John Bent smiled. They had passed the entrance to Chapel Lane, and were
standing within the thick privet hedge and the grove of trees which overshadowed
it. Not that the trees gave much shadow at that season, for their branches were
bare.</p>
<p>&quot;Tell me again the legend of the Grey Monk,&quot; said Anthony. &quot;I partly forget
it.&quot;</p>
<p>John Bent proceeded to do as he was bid, lowering his voice as befitted the
time and subject. But he had scarcely begun the narrative when the sound of
approaching footsteps struck on their ears, and his voice involuntarily died
away into silence. At the first moment, they thought the superintendent was
returning.</p>
<p>But no. The footsteps came from Chapel Lane. They drew more closely within
the cover of the hedge, and waited. A gentleman, walking fast and firmly,
emerged from the lane, crossed the road, went in at the gate of the chapel
ruins, seemed to take a hasty glance out over the sea, and then passed into the
Friar's Keep. Very much to the astonishment of John Bent, and somewhat to that
of Anthony, they recognized Mr. Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;He was taking a look at the sea by moonlight,&quot; whispered Anthony. &quot;I'll go
after him. I will. And we'll have it out under the moonbeams. What's he doing
now, I wonder, in that Friar's Keep?&quot;</p>
<p>Before John Bent could stop him--and, as the landlord said later, an impulse
prompted him to attempt it--the young man was off like a shot; entered the gate
in the wake of his uncle, and disappeared amid the cloisters of the Friar's
Keep.</p>
<p>The Master of Greylands must have emerged safely enough from those ghostly
cloisters: since he was abroad and well the next day as usual: but the ill-fated
Anthony Castlemaine was never again seen in this life.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h4><a name="div1_08" href="#div1Ref_08">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h4>
<h5>COMMOTION AT STILBOROUGH.</h5>
<br>

<p>On that same fatal Tuesday--and fatal it might well be called, so much of
evil did it bring in its train--there was commotion at Stilborough. Disagreeable
rumours of some kind had got abroad, touching the solvency of the bank. Whence
they arose, who had originated them, and what they precisely meant, nobody knew,
nobody could tell: but they were being whispered about from one man to another,
and the bank's creditors rose up in astonishment and fear.</p>
<p>&quot;Is it true? It cannot be.&quot; &quot;<i>What</i> is it?--what's amiss? Not possible
for Peter Castlemaine to be shaky. Where did you hear it? I'd trust the bank
with my life, let alone my money.&quot; &quot;But it's said that some gigantic speculation
has failed?&quot; &quot;Nonsense the bank would stand twenty failures: don't believe a
syllable of it.&quot; &quot;Well, rumour says the bank will stop to-morrow.&quot; &quot;Stop
to-morrow! What shall we do for our money?&quot; &quot;Don't know. <i>I</i> shall get mine
out to-day.&quot;</p>
<p>The above sentences, and others similar to them, might be heard from
different people in the streets of Stilborough. Those who were ultra-cautious
went into the bank and asked for their money. At first Thomas Hill paid: he
thought the demands were only in the regular course of business: but in a short
while he saw what it was--that a run upon the bank was setting in; and he went
into Mr. Peter Castlemaine's private room to consult his master. Fortunately the
rumours had only got afloat late in the afternoon, and it was now within a few
minutes of the usual time of closing. Not that, earlier or later, it could have
made much difference in the calamity; but it saved some annoyance to the bank's
inmates.</p>
<p>Had the bank been solvent, it would of course have kept its doors open,
irrespective of hours and customs; being insolvent, it closed them to the
minute, and the shutters too. Had Mr. Peter Castlemaine been able to meet the
demands for money, he would have been in the public room with a clear face,
reassuring the applicants: as it was, he bolted himself in his parlour. The
clerks drew down the shutters and shut the doors against the public: two or
three of the young men, who had to go out with letters or messages, got away
through the private entrance. Back went Thomas Hill to his master, knocking at
the door when he found it fastened.</p>
<p>&quot;It is only me, sir. All's safe.&quot;</p>
<p>Peter Castlemaine opened it. A change, that the faithful old clerk did not
like to see, was in his face. Hill's own face was scared and white enough just
then, as he well knew; but it could not wear the peculiar, sickly, shrunken look
he saw on his master's.</p>
<p>&quot;Where are they, Thomas? Is it really a run?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Really and truly, sir. What an unfortunate circumstance! A few days, and you
would have tided it over.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But where are they all?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Outside, sir, in the street, kicking and thumping at the doors and windows;
a great crowd of them by this time, and growing a bigger one every minute. We
managed to get the doors shut as tie clock struck, and then put down the
shutters.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Castlemaine drew his hand across his aching brow. &quot;I think this must have
been caused by Fosbrook,&quot; he remarked. &quot;He may have let an incautious word
drop.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He'd not do it, sir.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not intentionally: for his own sake. I knew it boded no good when I found he
meant to stay on at the Turk's Head. Alas! Alas!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There has not been a regular stoppage,&quot; said Thomas Hill. &quot;And if we can
manage to get assistance, and open again to-morrow morning----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't, Hill,&quot; interrupted the banker, in a tone of painful wailing. &quot;Don't
speak of hope! There's no hope left.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But, sir, when the remittance, which we expect, comes----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hush! look here.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Peter Castlemaine pushed an open letter towards his clerk. The old man's
hands trembled as he held it; his face grew whiter as he mastered the contents.
Hope was indeed gone. The worst had come. An embargo, or lien, had been laid in
London upon the expected remittances.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you get this letter this morning, sir? Why did you not tell me? It would
have been better to have stopped then.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I got it ten minutes ago, Thomas. It was sent from town by a special
messenger in a post-chaise and four which, of course, the estate will be charged
with. He came, by mistake, I suppose, to the private door; or perhaps he saw the
crowd round the public one: and he gave the letter into my own hands, saying he
would take my instructions back to town to-morrow morning, if I had any. All's
over.&quot;</p>
<p>Too truly did Thomas Hill feel the force of the words. All was over. But for
this last great misfortune, this lien upon the money that ought to have come,
they might have weathered the storm. The few past days had gone on pretty
quietly; and every day, passed without exposure, was so much gained. The Master
of Greylands, when applied to by his brother for a loan, had listened, and
placed at the bank's disposal a fairly good sum: not enough, not half enough,
for what it was wanted to stop, but still a great help.</p>
<p>&quot;Even now,&quot; began Thomas Hill, breaking the depressing silence, &quot;even now,
sir, if a meeting were called, and a statement of facts properly laid before the
creditors, they might consent to allow time.</p>
<p>&quot;Time!&quot; echoed Mr. Peter Castlemaine. &quot;What, with this yelling crowd
clamouring at the doors!--and with Fosbrook in the place!--and with a lien on
all the forthcoming remittances! And,&quot; he added, the shrunken grey look on his
countenance becoming more perceptible, as his voice dropped to a whisper--&quot;and
with the discovery at hand of the use I made of the Armannon bonds! The last
closing hour has come, Thomas, and nothing can save me!&quot;</p>
<p>Thomas Hill took off his spectacles to wipe the mist away. The failure of the
bank, and the disgrace attaching to these pecuniary misfortunes, seemed as
nothing, compared with the guilty shame that must fall on his master.</p>
<p>&quot;They may prosecute me criminally,&quot; breathed Mr. Peter Castlemaine, from
between his dry and ashy lips.</p>
<p>&quot;No, no,&quot; burst forth Thomas Hill. &quot;They'll never do that, sir. Think how you
have been respected! And besides--so far as I can understand the
complication--there will be money to pay everybody.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Every man will be paid in full to the uttermost farthing,&quot; spoke the banker
emphatically. &quot;But that's another thing. I sat up over my books nearly all last
night, making my calculations, and I find that there will be funds to meet all
claims. Only there's the waiting! Not any over perhaps; but there will be so
much as that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And to think that this miserable trouble should intervene!&quot; cried Thomas
Hill, wringing his hands. &quot;There will be my six thousand pounds to help you,
sir, with the expenses, and that.&quot;</p>
<p>Peter Castlemaine shook his head to the last sentence, but he made no denial
in words. He seemed to have neither words nor spirit left, and sat leaning his
brow upon his hand. The once fine fresh colour that was natural to his cheeks
had faded away, though its traces might be seen still. One might have fancied
that a thin veil of grey had been flung over the healthy bloom. In all his long
experience Thomas Hill had never, to his recollection, seen a man change like
this.</p>
<p>&quot;You look ill, sir,&quot; he said. &quot;Let me get you something to take.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I feel ill,&quot; was the answer. &quot;I ought to have confronted those people just
now in the other room, and should have done so, but that I felt physically
incapable. While I was reading the letter brought by the London messenger, a
sharp, curious pain seized me here,&quot; touching his left side. &quot;For some minutes I
could not move.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is the heart all right?&quot; hesitated the clerk--as if he were afraid to
breathe the question.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not know. During the past twelve months, since these troubles set in, I
have had a good deal of fluttering there: pain, too, at times.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You should consult a doctor, sir. Don't, pray, delay it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; sighed the unfortunate man. &quot;I suppose I should. When I get a little
out of this fret and turmoil--if I ever do get out of it--I'll see one. Lock the
desk for me, will you, Hill? There's nothing to keep it open for: no use to pore
over ledgers now.&quot;</p>
<p>He held out the key, sitting as he was, and Thomas Hill locked the desk and
returned the key to him. Strength and health seemed suddenly to have gone out of
Peter Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll go and get you a little warm brandy and water, sir. I'm sure you ought
to take it.&quot;</p>
<p>His master did not say Do, or Don't; and the clerk went for it. Getting it
mixed by Stephen--who looked frightened out of his senses by the commotion in
the street--he carried in the glass of hot liquor, and the banker sipped it. It
seemed to do him a little good; he looked less entirely depressed.</p>
<p>&quot;There's one thing I wanted to say, Thomas,&quot; he began. &quot;That young man who
came here last week--my brother Basil's son, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I've heard he is at Greylands, sir. Young Anthony, they say.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ay. Basil named him after the father. I should have done the same, had a son
been born to me. He came here that day, you know, asking me to tell him the
particulars of how Greylands' Rest was left; and I fear I was a little short
with him. I did not wish to be, I'm sure; but this--this trouble was lying on me
heavily. The young fellow spoke fairly enough; and, I daresay, I appeared cross.
He wanted me to interfere between him and James; which was a thing I should not
think of doing. I've thought about it since, lying awake at night; and I want
you to tell Anthony for me that I meant nothing, should you ever see him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But surely you will be seeing him for yourself, sir!&quot; cried the clerk,
thinking this a little strange.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know that I shall. Should James show him that he has no claim, he
may be going off to France again: and as to me, why, how do I know where I shall
be, or how things will go with me? You'll tell him, Thomas, that Greylands'
Rest, so far as I know, is legally my brother's; if I thought my father had
given it to Basil, I should not deem it right in James to hold it. But it's not
likely James would, were it not his.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did you not know, then, how the estate was left?&quot; asked Thomas Hill, in
surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;No; I did not trouble myself about it,&quot; was the banker's answer: and all
this while he seemed to be speaking as his faithful clerk had never before heard
him speak. Instead of the shrewd, observant, intellectual man of business, whose
every sense was keenly awake, he seemed weary and passive as a tired child. &quot;I
knew Greylands' Rest would not be mine; that if it was not left to Basil it
would be James's. James stayed in possession of it, and I supposed it was his: I
took that for granted, and did not question him. I believe surely it is his:
that my father left it to him: and, Thomas, you tell the young man, this young
Anthony, that such is my opinion. I don't think there can be a doubt of it.
James ought to show him the vouchers for it: Basil's son has a right to so much.
Only, don't say <i>that</i>: I do not want, I say, to interfere with James.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It would be the easiest way of settling the matter, sir, if Mr. Castlemaine
would do that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course it would. But then, you see, James never chooses to be questioned:
he resents any attempt at it; always did. As a boy, I remember, nothing ever
offended him like doubting his word.&quot;</p>
<p>At that moment there was a ring heard at the house door. The banker looked
startled, and then seemed to shrink within himself.</p>
<p>&quot;It is that Fosbrook!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;I thought he'd be coming. I cannot see
him. <i>You</i> go, and battle it out with him, Thomas he won't browbeat <i>you</i>.
Go! Don't let him come in here for the world.&quot;</p>
<p>But it was not Mr. Fosbrook. It was only one of the clerks, returning from
his errand. Thomas Hill, seeing the state of nervous depression that his master
was in, proposed to proceed at once to the Turk's Head, and hold there an
interview with the dreaded creditor: and the banker seized upon it eagerly.</p>
<p>&quot;Do, do!&quot; he said. &quot;There's no one I dread as I dread him.&quot;</p>
<p>As the clerk went out, he saw that many angry people lingered yet around the
house and doors. He went among them: he begged them to be still for that
evening, to leave matters in quiet until the morning, for that Mr. Peter
Castlemaine was very ill and quite unable to see anyone. The baffled creditors
showered down questions on the unfortunate clerk--who certainly felt the trouble
as keenly as did his master. Thomas Hill answered them to the best of his
ability: and at length one by one the malcontents took their departure, leaving
the street clear and the house quiet.</p>
<p>And no sooner was this accomplished, than the banker's handsome barouche
drove to the door, containing Miss Castlemaine and her chaperone, Mrs. Webb, who
had returned to her post the previous day. Opposite to them sat the young lady's
lover, William Blake-Gordon. All were in the highest spirits, talking and
laughing as though no such thing as care existed in the world, and utterly
unconscious of the trouble that had fallen on the house and the commotion that
had reigned outside it. They had, been to look over Raven's Priory, and Mary
Ursula was enchanted with it.</p>
<p>&quot;You will stay to dinner, William,&quot; she said, as he handed her out of the
carriage. &quot;Papa will be vexed if you do not.&quot;</p>
<p>He was only too ready to accept an invitation that would give him a few more
hours of her sweet companionship. It was close upon the dinner-hour--six.
Stephen was holding the hall-door open, with a long, grave face: they passed
him, noticing nothing.</p>
<p>&quot;I will not be long, William,&quot; she whispered, running up to her chamber.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, and she came forth again, attired for the evening. Her
dress was of rich blue silk; her cheeks had more colour in them than usual, the
effect of pleasurable excitement; her bright hair was disposed so as to set off
the exceeding beauty of her face. Mr. Blake-Gordon stood in the gallery, looking
at a new picture that some friend had recently made a present of to the banker.
As she joined him, he drew her arm within his.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a fine painting, Mary.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And it is hung well for night,&quot; she observed, &quot;for the rays of the
chandelier just fall on it. By day its place is a little dark. Have you seen
papa yet?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not yet. There goes six o'clock.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Webb, an elderly lady in black satin and point-lace cap, came downstairs
and turned into the drawing-room. Though a very dragon of a chaperone when
necessary, she knew quite well when to join the lovers, and when to leave them
alone.</p>
<p>They began pacing the gallery, arm in arm, looking at this picture,
criticising that. From paintings, their conversation turned to what just then
held a deeper interest for them--the future residence they expected so soon to
enter upon, Raven's Priory. This room should be the favourite morning room, and
that the favourite evening room; and the beautiful conservatory should have
their best care; and there should always be a blazing fire in the hall, not a
cold, bare, comfortless grate, as they had seen that day; and the gravel drive
should be widened, and some rocks and ferns put on the right hand in that bare
space--and so the dreams went on.</p>
<p>The clocks went on also. Mrs. Webb, reminded probably by her appetite, looked
out once or twice; the butler and Stephen, aware that the dinner was waiting,
and the cook angrily demanding whether it was to be served to-day or to-morrow,
passed and repassed out of the drawing-room. As to the lovers themselves, they
were unconscious of clocks and reminding appetites; for love, as we all know,
lives upon air. It was the custom of the house not to serve the dinner until the
banker appeared in the drawing-room: on rare occasions business detained him
beyond the hour.</p>
<p>So they paced on, those two, in their dream of happiness. And once, at the
darkest end of the gallery, when there was neither step nor sound near, Mr.
Blake-Gordon stole a kiss from that blushing face, so soon, as he fondly hoped,
to be all his.</p>
<p>&quot;My dear, is your papa out, do you know?&quot; questioned; Mrs. Webb, appearing at
the drawing-room door, as they again neared it. &quot;It is half-past six.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Half-past six!&quot; repeated Mary, in surprise. &quot;So late as that! No, I do not
know whether papa is out or in. Perhaps he is busy in his parlour? There's
Stephen: he may know. Stephen,&quot; she added, quitting the arm of Mr. Blake-Gordon,
and advancing towards the man, &quot;is papa below in his parlour?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There's no one in the parlour, ma'am, for I've been to look,&quot; was the
answer. &quot;I saw my master go up to his chamber some time ago, but I don't think
he can be in it all this while.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How long ago?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just before you came home, ma'am.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, of course, your master cannot be there still,&quot; interposed Mrs. Webb,
much interested in the colloquy, for she wanted her dinner frightfully. &quot;He must
have come down and gone out, Stephen.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very likely, ma'am.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am sure that Mr. Castlemaine has not come downstairs since we came in,&quot;
observed Mr. Blake-Gordon. &quot;If he had, I must have seen him. I have been here
all the time.&quot;</p>
<p>Mary Ursula laughed. &quot;I will tell you what it is,&quot; she said: &quot;papa has
dropped asleep on the sofa in his room. Twice lately he has done it when he has
had a very tiring day.&quot; She ran lightly up the stairs as she spoke, and knocked
at the chamber door. The lamp that hung in the corridor threw its light upon the
oaken panels, and upon her gleaming blue dress.</p>
<p>&quot;Papa!&quot;</p>
<p>There was no response, and Mary gently turned the handle, intending to open
the door about an inch, and call again. That her father was lying on the sofa in
a sound sleep, she felt as sure of as though she had seen him. But the door
would not open.</p>
<p>&quot;Papa! papa!&quot;</p>
<p>No: he did not awake, though she called very loudly. Hardly knowing what to
do, she ran downstairs again.</p>
<p>&quot;Papa must be in a very sound sleep, for I cannot make him hear, and the door
is fastened inside,&quot; she said, chiefly addressing Stephen, who was nearest to
her. &quot;I daresay he has had a fatiguing day.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, ma'am, it <i>have</i> been fatiguing; leastways the latter part of it,&quot;
replied the man, with an emphasis that they failed to catch. &quot;Some rude people
have been knocking here, and making a fine uproar.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Rude people knocking here!&quot; exclaimed Mrs. Webb, taking him up sharply.
&quot;What do you mean? What did they want?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know what they wanted, ma'am: something they couldn't get, I
suppose,&quot; returned the man, who had no suspicion of the real state of the case,
for he believed the house to be simply a mine of wealth that could have no
limit, just as children believe in the wondrous riches told of in a fairy tale.
&quot;I know I should like to have had the driving of 'em off! Master did well not to
see 'em.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But--did papa not see them?&quot; questioned Mary Ursula, surprised into asking
the question by this extraordinary story.</p>
<p>&quot;No, ma'am; and that's what I fancy they made the noise over. My master was
not well, either, this afternoon, for Mr. Hill came running out for hot brandy
and water for him.&quot;</p>
<p>What more would have been said, what doubt created, was stopped by the
appearance of Thomas Hill. He had just returned from his mission to the Turk's
Head. Apparently it had not been a pleasant mission: for his face was pale with
what looked like fear, and he, waiving ceremony, had come straight up the
stairs, asking for his master.</p>
<p>&quot;I must see him; I must see him instantly. I beg your pardon, dear Miss
Castlemaine, but it is of the last importance.&quot;</p>
<p>Had Thomas Hill only waited a moment before speaking, he would have heard
that the banker was fastened in his room. They told him now. He gave one scared
look around while taking in the words, and then bounded to the stairs.</p>
<p>&quot;Follow me,&quot; he cried, turning his livid face on the men. &quot;We must burst open
the door. I know he is ill.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Blake-Gordon, the butler and Stephen were up almost as soon as he. Mrs.
Webb laid her detaining arm on the young lady.</p>
<p>&quot;You must stay here, my dear: you <i>must</i>. They will do better without
you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But what can it be, save sleep?&quot; asked Mary Ursula, arresting her steps and
not knowing whether there was cause for alarm or not. &quot;When papa is very tired
he sleeps heavily. On Sunday night he dropped asleep when I was at the organ,
and I could not at first awaken him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course; I make no doubt he has fallen into a sound sleep; nothing else:
but it will not be seemly for you to go up with them, my dear,&quot; replied Mrs.
Webb, always the very essence of propriety. &quot;Hark! the door has given way.&quot;</p>
<p>Sleep? Yes, at first they did think the banker was asleep. He lay on the sofa
at full length, his head on the low pillow, his feet hanging down over the other
end. A candle, which he must have carried up with him, stood on the drawers, and
the wax candles in the dressing-glass had been previously lighted by the
servants. Altogether there was a good deal of light. They looked at the banker's
face by it: and saw--that the sleep was the sleep of death.</p>
<p>A gasping sob burst from Thomas Hill. He fell on his knees, the tears rolling
down his face.</p>
<p>&quot;My master! my dear master! oh, my master, my master!&quot;</p>
<p><i>He</i> saw what it was; perhaps felt somewhat prepared for it by the
previous events of the afternoon. The others were for the moment somewhat
stunned: but they did not think it could be death.</p>
<p>&quot;Run for a doctor!&quot; cried the butler to Stephen. &quot;He's in a faint. Run for
your life!&quot;</p>
<p>The butler himself did not attempt to run; he was too stout. Mr. Blake-Gordon
and Stephen, both slender and light of limb, sped away without their hats. The
butler raised his master's head.</p>
<p>&quot;Please to ring the bell, sir, for some brandy,&quot; he said to Mr. Hill. &quot;The
maids must bring up some hot flannels, too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is it possible that you can be deceived?&quot; sobbed the clerk--&quot;that you do not
see that it is death? Oh, my poor master?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<i>Death!</i> come now, don't talk in that uncomfortable way,&quot; retorted the
butler; not, however, feeling very comfortable as he said it. &quot;What should bring
death to the house in this sudden way? He is warm, too. Do please ring the bell,
sir.&quot;</p>
<p>The doctors came without delay, two of them; for Mr. Blake-Gordon brought
one, and Stephen another. But nothing could be done: it was indeed death: and
the medical men thought it had taken place the best part of an hour before. The
great banker of Stilborough, Peter Castlemaine, had ceased to exist.</p>
<p>But there was one momentous, dreadful question to be solved--what had caused
the death? Had it come by God's hand and will?--or had Peter Castlemaine himself
wrought it? The surgeons expressed no opinion at present; they talked in an
undertone, but did not let the world share their counsels. Thomas Hill overheard
one word, and it nearly sent him frantic.</p>
<p>&quot;How dare you say it gentlemen? Suicide! Mr. Peter Castlemaine would no more
lift his hand against himself than you would lift it. I would stake all the poor
bit of life I've got left--which won't be much now--that it is his heart that
has killed him. This very afternoon he complained of a sharp pain there; a
strange fluttering, he called it, and he looked white enough for a ghost. He
told me he had felt the same pain and fluttering at times before. There cannot
be a doubt, gentlemen, that it was his heart.&quot;</p>
<p>The doctors nodded seemingly in assent. One thing appeared to be
indisputable--that if the death was natural, no other cause than the heart could
be assigned for it. The face of the dead man was calm and unruffled as that of
an infant. But the elder of the doctors whispered something about an &quot;odour.&quot;</p>
<p>Mary Ursula came into the room when the medical men had gone. No tears were
in her eyes; she was as one stunned, paralyzed: unable in her shock of
bewilderment to take in the whole truth. She had deemed the room empty: but
Thomas Hill turned round from the sofa at her entrance.</p>
<p>&quot;He has had a good deal of trouble lately, my poor dear master, and it has
been too much for him, and broken his heart,&quot; he whispered in a piteous tone,
the tears running down his cheeks. &quot;God knows I'd have saved him from it if I
could, my dear young lady: I'd willingly have died for him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What kind of trouble has it been?&quot; asked Mary Ursula, letting the old man
take her hands, and gazing at him with a terrified and imploring countenance.</p>
<p>&quot;Money trouble, money trouble,&quot; answered the clerk. &quot;He was not used to it,
and it has broken his heart. Oh, my dear, don't grieve more than you can
help!--and don't think about the future, for all I have shall be yours.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You--think--it was heart disease?&quot; questioned Mary, in a dread, imploring
whisper. &quot;Do you <i>really</i> think it, Mr. Hill?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My dear, I am <i>sure</i> of it. Quite sure. And I only wonder now he did
not die in my arms this afternoon in the back parlour when the pain and
fluttering were upon him,&quot; added Thomas Hill, half choked with his emotion.
&quot;There was a great clamour with the creditors, and it terrified him more than I
thought. The fright must have struck to his heart, and killed him.&quot;</p>
<p>She sighed deeply. The same appalled look of terror clung to her face: the
reassurance did not seem to bring her the comfort that it ought. For Mary
Castlemaine had overheard that one covert word of suspicion breathed by the
medical men: and she had, and always would have, the awful doubt lying upon her
heart.</p>
<p>It was a dreadful night for her, poor bankrupt girl--bankrupt in happiness
from that hour. Mrs. Webb persuaded her to go to bed at last; and there she lay
getting through the hours as the unhappy do get through them. But, miserable
though it was, it would have been far more so could she have seen, as in a
mirror, what had taken place that night at Greylands in the Friar's Keep--the
disappearance of Anthony Castlemaine, and its cause.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h4><a name="div1_09" href="#div1Ref_09">CHAPTER IX.</a></h4>
<h5>A CURIOUS STORY.</h5>
<br>

<p>A bright and cheery morning with a soft westerly breeze. The flowing sea
sparkled in the sunlight; the little boats danced upon its waves; the birds on
the land sang merry songs to one another, cheated into a belief that spring had
come in.</p>
<p>There had been commotion in the streets of Stilborough on the previous day,
and especially around the banker's door, as we have already seen; but that
commotion was open and above board, as compared with the stir that was this
morning agitating Greylands. For, report was running wildly about that some
mysterious and unaccountable disaster had happened to Anthony Castlemaine.</p>
<p>Anthony Castlemaine had disappeared. There was no other word, save that,
applicable to the event: he had <i>disappeared</i>. And as Greylands had taken a
warm fancy to the young man, it rose up in great agitation. Almost with morning
light the village was being searched for him and inquiry made. People turned out
of their cottages, fishermen left their boats, some of the Grey Sisters even
came forth from the Nunnery: all eagerly asking what and how much was true.</p>
<p>The originator of the rumour was John Bent. He did not seem to know a great
deal more than other people; but nobody, save him, knew anything at all. The
Dolphin Inn was besieged; work was at a standstill; Mrs. Bent allowed even her
servant, Molly, to stand listening, with her arms akimbo, unreproved.</p>
<p>The story told by John Bent was a curious one. And, it should be intimated,
that, but for the fears stirring within the landlord's own breast, the
disappearance would not have been thought so much of at this early stage. But
John Bent had caught up the fear that some fatal harm had chanced to the young
man in fact, that he had been murdered! The landlord could not account for this
strong impression; he acknowledged that: but it was there, and he freely spoke
it out. The substance of the tale he told was as follows.</p>
<p>After Anthony Castlemaine had darted across the road and through the gate in
the wake of his uncle the Master of Greylands, as previously related, John Bent
stood still, watching for a minute or two, but could not see or hear anything of
either of them. He then, finding the night air somewhat cold, stamped up and
down the path, not losing sight of the opposite gate, and waiting for Anthony to
come out of it. Close upon this there rang out the report of a pistol. It was
accompanied, almost simultaneously, by an awful cry; the cry of a man in agony.
John Bent wondered where the cry came from and what it meant, but he never
thought to connect either cry or pistol with Anthony Castlemaine. The time
passed: John Bent began to find this waiting wearisome; he thought what a long
confab his guest was enjoying with Mr. Castlemaine, and hoped they were settling
matters amicably: and he wondered somewhat at their remaining in that dark,
ghostly Keep, instead of choosing the open moonlight. By-and-by a sailor
staggered past--for he had been taking more grog than was good for him--towards
his home in the village. He was smoking; and John Bent took his own pipe from
his pocket, filled it, and lighted it by the sailor's. The pipe consoled John
Bent, and the minutes passed somewhat less tediously: but when one o'clock rang
out and there were no signs of the young man, he began to think it very strange.
&quot;Surely they'd not stay all this while in that haunted Friar's Keep!--and not a
place to sit down on, and nothing but cold pillared cloisters to walk or stand
in, and <i>them</i> dark!&quot; cried John to himself--and he deliberated what he
should do. The prospect of marching into the Friar's Keep in search of his guest
was not altogether congenial to his taste, for John Bent did not like the chance
of meeting ghosts more than Greylands did: neither did he care to proceed home
himself and leave Anthony Castlemaine to follow at leisure. Another quarter of
an hour elapsed; and then--finding there was no help for it and quite tired
out--he put on a bold spirit, and crossed over to enter the gate. But the gate
was locked.</p>
<p>The gate was locked. And, had John Bent seen the whole row of high,
substantial palings suddenly lifted into the air, or thrown down to the earth,
he would not have stood more transfixed with astonishment.</p>
<p>For that gate had never been known to be locked, within his remembrance.
There certainly was a lock to it, but it had always lacked a key. The latch was
good, and that was all the fastening used, or needed. John Bent stood with open
mouth, gasping out his surprise to the air.</p>
<p>&quot;What on earth does this mean?&quot;</p>
<p>He shook the gate. At least, he would have shaken it, had it been less
substantially firm: but it scarcely moved under his hand. And then he set on and
shouted at the top of his voice, hoping his guest would hear.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Anthony Castlemaine! Shall you be much longer, Mr. Anthony Castlemaine?&quot;</p>
<p>The light breeze took his voice over the chapel ruins and carried its echoes
out to sea; but there came back no answer of any kind.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, this is a rum go,&quot; cried John, looking up, and down, and round about,
in his bewilderment. &quot;Surely Mr. Anthony can't have come out and gone home!&quot; he
added, the unlikely notion flashing on him; for, when thoroughly puzzled we are
all apt to catch at straws of improbability. &quot;He <i>couldn't</i> have come out
without my seeing him, and me never beyond view of the gate: unless it was in
the minute that I was lighting my pipe by Jack Tuff's, when I had my back
turned. But yet--how was it Mr. Anthony did not see me?&quot;</p>
<p>Unable to solve these doubts, but still thinking that was how it must have
been, the landlord went home with a rapid step. Before he gained it, he had
quite made his mind up that it was so; he fully believed his guest was by this
time sound asleep in his bed, and called himself a donkey for waiting out all
that while. John Bent put his hand on the handle of his door to enter softly,
and found it fastened. Fastened just as firmly as the gate had been.</p>
<p>&quot;Where's Ned, I wonder?&quot; he cried aloud, alluding to his man; and he knocked
with his hand pretty sharply.</p>
<p>There was no more response to this knock than there had been to the shouts he
had been lately sending forth. He knocked again and shook the door. The
moonbeams still played upon the sea; a white sail or two of the night fishing
boats gleamed out; he put his back against the door and gazed on the scene while
he waited. No good, as he knew, to go round to the front entrance; that was sure
to be closed. John knocked the third time.</p>
<p>The window above his head was flung open at this juncture, and Mrs. Bent's
nightcapped head came out.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, it's you, is it!&quot; she tartly cried. &quot;I thought, for my part, you had
taken up your abode in the road for the night.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ned's sitting up, I suppose, Dorothy. Why does he not open the door?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ned will not open the door till he has my orders. There! A pretty decent
thing, this is, for a respectable householder of your age to come home between
one and two in the morning! If you are so fond of prancing up and down the road
in the moonlight, filling a fresh pipe at every trick and turn, why don't you
stay there till the house is opened to-morrow?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Jack Tuff must have told you that!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Jack Tuff did tell it me,&quot; retorted Mrs. Bent. &quot;I stayed at the door
looking for you till half after twelve. And a tidy state <i>he</i> was in!&quot;
added the good lady in additional wrath. &quot;His nose touching the ground, a'most
every step he took!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just let me come in, Dorothy. I've not stayed out all this while for
pleasure--as you may be sure.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You've stayed for aggravation perhaps; to keep people up. Where's Mr.
Anthony Castlemaine?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He's come home, isn't he?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I dare say you know very well whether he is or not!&quot; returned Mrs. Bent from
her window.</p>
<p>&quot;But Dorothy, woman, it is for him I've been waiting. He went into the
Friar's Keep, and he's never come out again--unless he came when I did not see
him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Friar's Keep!&quot; repeated the landlady, in the most mocking tone she could
use. &quot;What excuse will you invent next?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's no excuse: it's true. We saw Mr. Castlemaine go in there, and Mr.
Anthony ran over and followed him, saying he'd have out the quarrel under the
moonlight. And I stood cooling my heels outside, waiting for him all that while;
till at last I began to think he must have come out and passed me unseen. He <i>
has</i> come home, has he not?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He is <i>not</i> come home,&quot; said Mrs. Bent.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, let the door be opened.&quot;</p>
<p>As the story sounded a mysterious one, and Mrs. Bent had her curiosity, and
as her husband moreover was a staid man, not at all given to this kind of
offence in general, she allowed him to come in, herself opening the door. He
gave her a summary of the story, she wrapped in a warm shawl while she stood to
listen to it and to make her comments. Anthony Castlemaine had not come home;
she had seen nothing at all of him; or of anybody else, tipsy Jack Tuff
excepted.</p>
<p>A kind of scared feeling, a presentiment of evil, crept over John Bent. For
the first time, he began to wonder whether the pistol-shot he had heard had
struck the young man, whether the agonised cry was his. He went into Anthony's
bedroom, and saw with his own eyes that it was empty. It was not that he
questioned his wife's word; but he felt confused and doubtful altogether--as
though it were not possible that Anthony could be absent in this unaccountable
manner.</p>
<p>&quot;I must go back and look for him, Dorothy woman.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You'll take the key with you, then,&quot; said Mrs. Bent; who, for a wonder, did
not oppose the proposition: in fact, she thought it right that he should go. And
back went John Bent to the Friar's Keep.</p>
<p>He did not at all like this solitary walking, lovely though the night was; he
would rather have been asleep in bed. The Grey Nunnery lay steeped in silence
and gloom; not a single light shone from any of its windows; a sure sign that
just now there could be no sick inmates there. John Bent reached the gate again,
and the first thing he did was to try it.</p>
<p>It yielded instantly. It opened at his touch. And the man stood not much less
amazed than he had before been to find it fastened. At that moment the sound of
approaching footsteps in the road struck on his ear; he turned swiftly, his
heart beating with eager hope: for he thought they might prove to be the steps
of Anthony Castlemaine.</p>
<p>But they were those of Mr. Nettleby. The officer was returning from his
mission of night supervision, whatever it might especially be. John Bent met
him, and told his tale.</p>
<p>&quot;Nonsense!&quot; cried the superintendent, after he had listened. &quot;They would not
be likely to stay in those deserted cloisters of the Friar's Keep. Are you sure
it was <i>Mr. Castlemaine</i> you saw go in?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Quite sure. But I can't think what he could want there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You don't think you were dreaming?&quot; asked Mr. Nettleby, who by this time
evidently fancied the tale was altogether more like a dream than a reality. &quot;I
don't believe the gate has a key, or that it ever had one.&quot;</p>
<p>He was examining the gate as he spoke. The lock was there as usual; but of
any sign that a key had been in it that night there was none. Crossing the
ruins, they stood looking out over the sea; at the line of glittering moonlight,
at the distant boats catching their fish. From that they went into the Friar's
Keep. Its moss-eaten Gothic door lay open to the chapel ruins. Pillars of stone
supported the floor--the floor which the spirit of the dead-and-gone Grey Friar
was supposed to haunt. It was rather a ghostly-looking place altogether; the
intersecting pillars and the arches above, and some open arches facing the sea,
where a little light streamed through. They could not see the sea from this
place, for the outer wall was nearly as high as they were; but not so high as
the arches; and the light and the salt fresh smell of the sea came wafting in.
There they stood on the stone floor of those cloisters--as people had fallen
into the way of calling them--and shouted out the name of Anthony Castlemaine.
Neither sight nor sound came back in answer: all was quiet and lonely as the
grave; there was not the slightest sign that any one had been there.</p>
<p>&quot;If they <i>did</i> come in here, as you say,&quot; observed Mr. Nettleby, with
that same ring of disbelief in his voice, &quot;I'll tell you what it is, Bent. They
must have come out again at once, and gone home together to Greylands' Rest.&quot;</p>
<p>This view of the case had not presented itself to the mind of John Bent. He
revolved it for an instant, and then saw that it was the most feasible solution
of the problem. But he did not feel quite satisfied; for it was difficult to
fancy Anthony Castlemaine would so go off without telling him. Still he accepted
it; and he and the officer quitted the Keep, and turned their steps homeward. In
his own mind the superintendent fully believed John Bent had been asleep and
dreaming; it was so impossible to fancy any sane man promenading in the chapel
ruins or the Keep at night. And the Master of Greylands, of all people!</p>
<p>&quot;Did you get upon the trail of any smugglers at Beeton asked John Bent.</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Mr. Nettleby, rather savagely, for he had had his night's work for
nothing. &quot;Couldn't see any traces of them. I do suspect that Beeton, though. I
believe it contains a nest of the lawless wretches!&quot;</p>
<p>He turned in at his own gate as he spoke. The landlord went on and was
speedily at home again. Anthony Castlemaine had not come in.</p>
<p>Before eight o'clock in the morning, John Bent, feeling doubtful and uneasy,
went up to Greylands' Rest. He noticed that all the blinds were down, and some
of the shutters closed. Miles, the servant man, was outside the back-entrance
door, shaking mats.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought none of you could be up yet,&quot; began the landlord, &quot;with all the
blinds down! I'm sure the house looks as though somebody had died in it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And somebody has died, more's the pity; though not in the house,&quot; replied
Miles, turning his face, full of grave concern, on the speaker. &quot;A messenger was
here soon after six this morning to fetch the master to Stilborough. Mr. Peter
Castlemaine died suddenly last night.&quot;</p>
<p>The landlord was shocked. He could hardly believe it. &quot;Mr. Peter Castlemaine
dead!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;It can't be true, Miles.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's too true,&quot; returned Miles.</p>
<p>&quot;But he was so strong and healthy! He had not a trace of illness about him!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ay. But they say it was the heart.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it's sad news any way, and I'm sorry for him,&quot; said John Bent. &quot;Is
young Mr. Castlemaine here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not just now. He'll be home some time this afternoon. He went off to
Newerton yesterday on business.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't mean him--Mr. Harry. I mean Mr. Anthony Castlemaine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What should bring that young man here?&quot; loftily retorted Miles, who made a
point of sharing in all the prejudices of his master.</p>
<p>John Bent told his tale. It was listened to with disbelieving and resentful
ears.</p>
<p>&quot;My master in at that there blessed scared place, the Friar's Keep, at twelve
o'clock at night! Well, I wonder what next you'll say, Mr. Bent?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I saw him go in,&quot; returned John Bent.</p>
<p>&quot;It couldn't have been him. It's not likely. What should he want there? When
us servants went to bed at ten, the master was in the red parlour. As to that
other young man you speak of, that he has not been anigh the house <i>I</i> can
answer for.&quot;</p>
<p>John Bent felt as if he were in the midst of a fog, through which no light
could be seen. &quot;You say Mr. Castlemaine is at Stilborough, Miles?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He went off there soon after six o'clock. And wasn't he cut up when he heard
the news about his brother!&quot; added Miles. &quot;His lips and face had no more red in
them than <i>that</i>&quot;--pointing to a snowdrop under the wall. &quot;He looked just
like a man who had got a shock.&quot;</p>
<p>It was of no use for John Bent to linger. Anthony Castlemaine was not to be
heard of at Greylands' Rest. He took his departure; and, in the absence of any
other clue to follow, went making inquiries in the village. Before long, not a
single inhabitant, from one end of it to the other, but had heard and was making
comments on his tale.</p>
<p>The Dolphin Inn was a crowded place that day, and its landlord the centre of
attraction. People were in and out incessantly, listening to the singular
history. Numbers flocked to the Friar's Keep, and to every other spot in
Greylands likely or unlikely for a man to be hidden in, dead or living; but
there was no trace anywhere of the presence of Anthony Castlemaine. Setting
aside the disappearance, the tale itself excited wonder; and that part of it
relating to the entrance into the chapel ruins of Mr. Castlemaine, and the
subsequent sound of a shot and cry, and of the locked gate, was received by some
with incredulity. Opinions were hazarded that the landlord's eyes might have
deceived him, his ears and his fingers played him false; that Mr. Castlemaine
must have been altogether a myth; the supposed locked gate been only his
awkwardness, and the shot and cry nothing but the scream of a sea bird. In this
one latter point, however, John Bent's account was established by other
testimony, coming, singular to say, from the Grey Ladies. It appeared that
Sister Mildred was very ill that night, and two of the others sat up with her,
Sisters Mona and Ann. The room of the Superioress faced the sea, and was the
last room at the end next the chapel ruins. As the Sisters sat there watching in
the stillness of the night, they were suddenly startled by the sound of a shot,
and by a scream as from some one wounded. So, in regard to the truth of this
part of John Bent's account, there could no longer be a doubt.</p>
<p>In the afternoon Mr. Castlemaine returned from Stilborough. The commotion
Greylands was in rendered it impossible for him to remain long ignorant of what
had taken place, and of the manner in which his name was mixed up with it. Being
a man of quick perception, of penetrating judgment, he could not fail to see
that some suspicion must attach to himself in the public mind; that the alleged
story, taken in conjunction with previous facts: the pretentions of his nephew
to Greylands' Rest, and their hostile meeting in the fields earlier in the day:
must inevitably excite doubt and comment. Proud, haughty, and self-contained
though the Master of Greylands was, this matter was of too grave a nature, and
might bring too many unpleasant consequences in its train, for him to ignore it.
He deemed it well to throw himself forthwith into the battle; and he went out to
the Dolphin. On his way he encountered Commodore Teague. The latter had been at
sea since early morning in his cutter--as he was apt to call that sailing boat
of his--and had but now, on landing, had his ears assailed with the story. A few
exchanged sentences between Mr. Castlemaine and the Commodore, and they parted;
Mr. Castlemaine proceeding to the inn.</p>
<p>&quot;What <i>is</i> this absurd story?&quot; he demanded of John Bent, lifting his hat
as he entered the best kitchen to the knot of people assembled there. &quot;I cannot
make head or tail of it.&quot;</p>
<p>For the fiftieth time at least, the landlord recounted the history. It was
listened to with breathless interest, even by those who had done nothing but
listen to it for many previous hours.</p>
<p>&quot;And do you expect sensible people to believe this, John Bent?&quot; were the
first answering words of the Master of Greylands.</p>
<p>&quot;It's true, whether they believe it or not,&quot; said John. &quot;It was yourself,
sir, was it not, that we saw pass through the gate into the chapel ruins?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<i>I!</i>&quot; scornfully repeated Mr. Castlemaine. &quot;What do you suppose should
take me to such a place as that, at midnight? If all your points are as correct
as that, Mr. Bent, your story will not hold much water.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I said it was not likely to be Mr. Castlemaine,&quot; spoke up the superintendent
of the coastguard. &quot;I told Mr. Bent so at the time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I put it to you all, generally, whether it <i>was</i> likely,&quot; pursued Mr.
Castlemaine, glancing defiantly about him.</p>
<p>&quot;All I can say is this,&quot; said John Bent: &quot;that if it was not Mr. Castlemaine,
my eyes must have strangely deceived me, and young Mr. Anthony's must have
deceived him. Why, the night was as light as day.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Eyes do deceive sometimes,&quot; remarked Mr. Castlemaine. &quot;I know that mine have
on occasion deceived me at night, good though their sight is. And of all
deceptive lights, the moon's light is the worst.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sir, if it was not you it must have been your wraith,&quot; said John Bent,
evidently not inclined to give in. &quot;You passed close by us sideways, coming out
of the Chapel Lane, and crossed the road in front of us. Had you just turned
your head sharp to the right, you must have seen us under the hedge.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Was it the Grey Friar, think you?&quot; asked Mr. Castlemaine. And John Bent did
not like the bantering tone, or the suppressed laugh that went around.</p>
<p>&quot;That some one crossed from the Chapel Lane may be true: for I do not see how
you could purely imagine it,&quot; conceded Mr. Castlemaine, after a pause. &quot;But it
was not I. Neither can I understand nor conceive what anybody should want in the
chapel ruins at that time of night. We are most of us rather given to shun the
place.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;True, true,&quot; murmured the room.</p>
<p>&quot;And the locked gate,&quot; proceeded Mr. Castlemaine, &quot;how do you account for
that? Where did the key come from to lock it? According to what you say, John
Bent, it would appear that Mr. Anthony Castlemaine must have locked it; since
you maintain that no one went in or came out subsequently to himself. If he
locked it, he must have unlocked it. At least, that is the inference naturally
to be drawn.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I say that the gate never was locked,&quot; put in Superintendent Nettleby. &quot;The
latch might have caught at the minute, and caused Mr. Bent to fancy it was
locked.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You may as well tell me I don't know when a place is open and when it's
shut,&quot; retorted John Bent.</p>
<p>&quot;And the pistol, again!--or gun?&quot; remonstrated Mr. Castlemaine. &quot;It does not
stand to reason that people should be firing off guns and pistols at midnight. I
fancy that must be altogether a mistake----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Grey Ladies can speak to that much, sir,&quot; interrupted Mrs. Bent. &quot;As
Sister Ann, here, can tell you.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Castlemaine turned on his heel and brought his eyes to bear on Sister
Ann. She was sitting in the corner near the clock, her basket as usual in her
hand. For she had come out to do errands, and been seduced by curiosity into the
Dolphin, to take her share in the gossip.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, sir, we heard the pistol, or gun, whichever it was, and the human cry
that came with it,&quot; she said to Mr. Castlemaine. &quot;Sister Mona and I were
watching in Sister Mildred's room--for the fever was very bad upon her last
night, and she was restless and wandering, poor lady! It was all quite still. I
was knitting and Sister Mona was reading; you might have heard a pin drop
indoors or out; when there burst upon our ears a loud shot, followed by a human
cry. A thrilling scream, it was, making me and sister Mona start up in terror.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was like a death scream,&quot; said John Bent. &quot;And I cannot,&quot; he added,
looking at Mr. Castlemaine, &quot;get it out of my head that it was his scream--young
Mr. Anthony's.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;From what direction did it come?&quot; asked Mr. Castlemaine of the landlord.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't tell, sir. I was walking about on the opposite side of the road, and
at first I thought it came from seaward; but it sounded very near.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It sounded to us as though it came from the chapel rains, or from the strip
of beach below it,&quot; said Sister Aim. &quot;We did not hear anything more.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And I did not think at the time to connect that shot and scream with Mr.
Anthony Castlemaine,&quot; pursued John Bent. &quot;It never came anigh my mind to do it,
never. It do now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it is altogether a most extraordinary and unaccountable affair,&quot;
remarked Mr. Castlemaine. &quot;Strange to say, I was abroad last night myself and
near the spot, but not as late as you describe this to have been. Between ten
and eleven I went down the lane as far as the Hutt. Teague was, I had heard,
purposing to go out in his boat for a few hours to-day; and I, not having been
very well, lately, thought I should like to go with him, and went down to say
so. I stayed and had a pipe with him, and I think it must have been half-past
eleven when I left.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And did you go straight home from the Hutt, sir?&quot; asked John Bent, eagerly.</p>
<p>&quot;I went straight home from the Hutt's door to my door,&quot; emphatically replied
Mr. Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;And did not go anigh the other end of the lane at all?--nor the Friar's
Keep?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly not. I tell you I went straight home. I went direct from Teague's
house to mine.&quot;</p>
<p>That Mr. Castlemaine was candid in stating this matter spontaneously, when he
might have concealed it, his hearers mentally saw, and it told in his favour.
But it did not lessen the perplexity, or the mist that the affair was shrouded
in. He turned to depart.</p>
<p>&quot;I shall at once institute a thorough search; and, if necessary, summon the
law to my aid,&quot; said he. &quot;Not that I fear any real harm has befallen my nephew
Anthony; but it will be satisfactory to ascertain where he is. I fancy he must
have gone off somewhere, perhaps on some sudden and uncontemplated impulse. It
may be, that he is given to take these impromptu flights; as was his father
before him, my brother Basil.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Castlemaine passed out as he spoke, with a bend of the head to the
company. He was looking pale and ill; they could but notice it throughout the
entire interview; and his face had a worn, sad cast of sorrow on it, never
before seen there.</p>
<p>&quot;He has brought that look back from Stilborough,&quot; remarked John Bent. &quot;There
are bad fears, it's whispered, about his brother's death: we have not got the
particulars yet. But as to Mr. Anthony's having walked off in any promiscuous
manner, it's the silliest thought that ever was spoken.&quot;</p>
<p>Commodore Teague, in his blue sailor's costume, came looming in, his hands in
his pockets. He had made haste down from the Hutt (having been obliged to go
there on landing, to carry his gun and sundry other articles from his boat, and
to light his fires) to hear the details of the mysterious story or, as he chose
to express it, the wrongs and the rights on't.</p>
<p>So John Bent once more recounted the particulars, assisted by the tongues of
all the company--for they did not stand in awe of this listener as they did of
Mr. Castlemaine. The Commodore listened with incredulity: not to say ridicule.</p>
<p>&quot;Look here, John Bent, you may tell that tale to the marines. I can explain
away some of it myself. Bless my heart! To think you folk should be running your
head again all them marvels, when there's none to run 'em against. That gun that
went off was mine,&quot; concluded the Commodore; who liked to put on a free-and-easy
grammar when in familiar intercourse with Greylands, though he could be a
gentleman when with such people as the Castlemaines.</p>
<p>&quot;Your gun!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was. And as to Mr. Castlemaine, you no more saw him go into the Friar's
Keep than you saw me go. Last night, I was smoking my pipe and cleaning my
gun--for I meant to shoot a few birds out at sea to-day--when who should come
knocking at the Hutt door but Mr. Castlemaine. He'd been feeling out of sorts,
he said, and thought a sail would do him good, and would like to go with me
to-day--for it seems the whole parish had heard I was going. With all my heart,
I answered; I'd be proud of his company. He sat down and took a pipe; smoking's
contagious, you know: and we talked about this and that. When he left I saw him
to the door, and watched him turn up the lane towards his house. It don't stand
to reason he'd come down again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He told us all this himself, Commodore.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did he!--what, Mr. Castlemaine? Well, it's true. After he was gone, I got to
my gun again, which I had laid aside when he entered. It struck twelve before I
finished it. After that, I loaded it, took it to the door, and fired it off into
the air. That was the shot you heard, landlord.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And the cry?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Never was any cry to hear. 'Twas fancy. I made none, and I know I heard
none.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What time was it when your gun went off?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Past twelve; I don't rightly know how much. I went to bed and to sleep
without looking at the clock. This morning word was brought me that Mr.
Castlemaine had been fetched to Stilborough; and I took out Ben Little in the
boat instead.&quot;</p>
<p>But this explanation did not go for so much as it might have done. The
Commodore was in the habit of telling the most incredible sea yarns; and faith,
in that respect, was wanting in him. Moreover, the strong impression on John
Bent's mind was, that it was a pistol-shot he had heard, not a gun. Above all,
there remained the one broad fact of the disappearance: Anthony Castlemaine had
been alive and well and amidst them the previous night, and to-day he was not.
Altogether the commotion, the dread, and the sense of some mysterious evil
increased: and lying upon many a heart, more or less, was a suspicion of the
part played in it by Mr. Castlemaine.</p>
<p>Dusk was approaching when a horseman rode past the Dolphin: Mr. Harry
Castlemaine on his return from Newerton. Seeing what looked like an unusual
bustle round the inn doors, he pulled up. Molly ran out.</p>
<p>&quot;What's agate?&quot; asked Mr. Harry. &quot;You seem to have got all the world and his
wife here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's feared as it's murder, sir,&quot; returned simple Molly.</p>
<p>&quot;<i>Murder!</i>&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, sir, Mr. Anthony Castlemaine went into the Friar's Keep last night,
and have never come out again. It's thought he was shot there. A dreadful cry
was heard.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Shot! Who shot him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;'Tain't known, sir. Some says it was Mr. Castlemaine that was in there along
of him.&quot;</p>
<p>Harry Castlemaine drew up his haughty head; a dark frown knitted his brow.
But that she was a woman, ignorant and stupid, and evidently unconscious of all
the word's might imply, he might have struck her as she stood.</p>
<p>&quot;And there's dreadful news in from Stilborough, Mr. Harry, sir,&quot; resumed the
girl. &quot;Mr. Peter Castlemaine was found dead in his chamber last night.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; shouted Harry, thinking she must be playing upon him with all these
horrors.</p>
<p>&quot;It's true, sir. The Master of Greylands have not long got back from seeing
him. He died quite sudden, poor gentleman, shut up in his room, and not a soul
anigh him to watch his last breath.&quot;</p>
<p>It was almost too much. His uncle dead, his cousin disappeared, his father
suspected he knew not yet of what. Never a more cruel moment, than that had
dawned for Harry Castlemaine.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h4><a name="div1_10" href="#div1Ref_10">CHAPTER X.</a></h4>
<h5>JUST AS SHE HAD SEEN IT IN HER DREAM.</h5>
<br>

<p>Evils do not always come alone. It sometimes happens that before one
astounding ill is barely glanced at, another has fallen. This was the case at
Stilborough.</p>
<p>The town awoke one morning to find that the bank had stopped payment, and
that the banker was dead. Never before in the memory of man had the like
consternation been known. It can be better imagined than written. At once the
worst was anticipated. No one had ever been so confided in as was Mr. Peter
Castlemaine. His capacity for business, his honour and integrity, his immense
wealth, had passed into a proverb. People not only trusted him, but forced upon
him that trust. Many and many a man had placed in his hands all they possessed:
the savings perhaps of half a lifetime; and now they saw themselves ruined and
undone.</p>
<p>Never had the like excitement been known in the quiet town; never so much
talking and gesticulating; metaphorically speaking, so much sighing and sobbing.
And indeed it is to be doubted if this last was all metaphor. Thomas Hill had
never been so sought after; so questioned and worried; so raved at and abused as
now. All he could implore of them was to have a little patience until accounts
could be gone into. Things might not, he represented, turn out as badly as
people supposed. Nobody listened to him; and he felt that if all days were to be
as this day, he should soon follow his master to the grave. Indeed, it seemed to
him now, in the shock of this dreadful blow--his master's ruin and his master's
untimely end--that his own existence henceforth would be little better than a
death in life.</p>
<p>In the very midst of the commotion, there was brought to Stilborough news of
that other calamity--the mysterious disappearance of young Anthony Castlemaine.
He had been seen to enter the Friar's Keep the previous night, and had never
come out again. The name of the Master of Greylands appeared to be mixed up in
the affair; but in what manner was not yet understood. Verily misfortunes seemed
to be falling heavily just now upon the Castlemaines.</p>
<p>This last event, however, after exciting due comment and wonder, was lost
sight of in the other evil: for the first nearly concerned the interests of
Stilborough, and the latter did not concern them at all. Their ruin, their ruin!
That was the all-absorbing topic in the minds of the bewildered citizens.</p>
<p>In inquiry into the death of Peter Castlemaine ended in a decision that he
had died from heart disease. This was arrived at chiefly by the testimony and
the urgent representation of Thomas Hill. One of the medical men was supposed to
hold a contrary opinion; and the dreadful doubt, previously spoken of, would
always lie on Miss Castlemaine's mind; but the other was the accepted view. He
was buried in the neighbouring churchyard, St. Mark's: Parson Marston, who had
so often and so recently sat at his dinner-table, performing the service.</p>
<p>Gradually the first excitement diminished. Brains and tempers calmed down.
For, added to that natural depression that succeeds to undue emotion, there
arose a report that things would be well, after all, and everybody paid to the
full.</p>
<p>In fact, it was so. The money that had been so long waited for--the
speculation that had at last turned up trumps--was pouring in its returns. And
there arose another source of means to be added to it.</p>
<p>One morning the great Nyndyll Mine Company, that had been looked upon as
being as good as dead, took a turn for the better; received, so to say, a new
lease of life. A fresh vein of surprising richness and unbounded extent, had
been struck: the smallest shareholder might immediately reckon that his fortune
was an accomplished fact: and those lucky enough to be largely interested might
cease speculation for ever, and pass the time in building themselves castles and
palaces--with more solid foundations than the air will furnish--to live in. The
shares went up in the market like rockets: everyone was securing them as eagerly
as we should pick up diamonds if we got the chance. In a very short time, the
shares held by the house of Mr. Peter Castlemaine might have been resold for
fifteen times the original amount paid for them.</p>
<p>&quot;Is this true, Hill?&quot; asked Mr. Castlemaine, who had come bounding over on
horseback from Greylands' Rest at the first rumour of the news, and found the
old clerk at his post as usual, before the private desk that had been his
master's. &quot;Can it be true?&quot; repeated Mr. Castlemaine.</p>
<p>He was changed since his brother's death. That death, or something else, had
told upon him strangely. He and Peter had been fond of each other. James had
been proud of his brother's position in the country; his influence and good
name. The shock had come upon him unexpectedly, as upon every one else: and, in
a manner, affected him far more. Then, his interests were largely bound up with
those of his brother; and though if he had lost all he had lent him he would
still be a rich man, yet the thought was not to be indulged with indifference or
contemplated pleasantly. But to do him justice, these considerations sank into
insignificance, before the solemn fact of his brother's death, and the mystery
and uncertainty enshrouding it.</p>
<p>&quot;Is it true, Hill?&quot; he reiterated before the clerk had time to speak. &quot;Or is
it all as a miserable delusion of Satan.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is true enough, sir,&quot; answered Thomas Hill. &quot;The shares have gone
suddenly up like nothing I ever knew. Alas, that it should be so!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Alas!&quot; echoed Mr. Castlemaine. &quot;What mean you, Hill? has trouble turned your
brain?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was thinking of my poor dear master,&quot; said the old man. &quot;It was this very
mine that helped to kill him. You see now, Mr. Castlemaine, how good his
speculations were, how sound his judgment! Had he lived to see this turn of
affairs, all would have been well.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Too late to speak of that,&quot; said Mr. Castlemaine, with a deep sigh. &quot;He is
dead; and we must now give our attention to the living. This slice of luck will
enable you to pay all demands. The shares must be realized at once.</p>
<p>&quot;Enable us to pay every one, as I believe,&quot; assented Thomas Hill. &quot;And
otherwise we should not.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What a strange chance it seems to be!&quot; musingly observed Mr. Castlemaine. &quot;A
chance that rarely occurs in life. Well, as I say, it must be seized upon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And without delay, sir. The shares that have gone up so unexpectedly, may
fall as suddenly. I'll write to-day.&quot; Mr. Castlemaine rose to depart. The clerk,
who was settling to his papers, again looked off to ask a question.</p>
<p>&quot;Have any tidings turned up, sir, of poor Mr. Anthony?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not that I have heard of. Good-day, Hill.&quot;</p>
<p>The expected money was realized; other expected money was realized; and in an
incredibly short space of time, for poor Thomas Hill worked with a will, the
affairs of the bank were in a way of settlement, every creditor to be fully
satisfied, and the late unfortunate banker's name to be saved. Anything that had
been underhanded in his dealing, Thomas Hill and Mr. Castlemaine had contrived
to keep from the public.</p>
<p>But one creditor, whose name did not appear on the books, and who had put in
no demand to be satisfied, was passed over in silence. Mary Ursula's fortune had
been hopelessly sacrificed; and it was already known that little, if anything,
would be left for her. She knew how and why her fortune had gone: Mr. Hill had
explained it all to her; it had helped to save her father's honour and good
name; and had it been ten times the amount, she would freely have given it for
such a purpose, and been thankful that she had it to give.</p>
<p>Seeing what it had done, she did not as far as she herself was concerned,
look upon it with one moment's regret. True she was now poor; very poor compared
with the past: she would have at most but about a hundred and fifty pounds a
year; but she was in too much trouble to think much of money now. One heavy
weight had been lifted--the sickening dread that the creditors would lose part
or all. On that one point she was now at rest. But there were other things.
There was the underlying current of fear that her father had not died of heart
disease; there was the mysterious perplexity attending the disappearance of her
cousin Anthony; and there was her own engagement to Mr. Blake-Gordon.</p>
<p>Her position was now so different from what it had been when he proposed to
her, and the severity, the pride, the arrogance of Sir Richard so indisputable,
that she feared the worst. Moreover, she knew, from the present conduct of both
father and son, that she had cause to fear it.</p>
<p>Twice, and twice only, had William Blake-Gordon come to her since her
father's death, and he might so easily have come to her every day in her
desolation! Each time he had been kind and loving as ever; not a suspicion, not
a hint of separation had appeared in look or tone; but in his manner there had
been something never seen before: a reticence; a keeping back, as it were, of
words that ought to come out: and instinct told her that all was not as it used
to be.</p>
<p>&quot;How does your father take the news?--What does he say to it, and to my loss
of fortune?--Is he still willing to receive me?&quot; she had asked on each occasion;
and as often he had contrived to put aside the questions without satisfactory
answer.</p>
<p>Days went on; her position, as to lack of fortune, was known abroad; and the
suspense she endured was making her ill. One morning at the breakfast table, as
she finished reading some letters that had been delivered for her, Mrs. Webb,
who had scanned the letters outside from the opposite side of the table, put a
question that she often did put.</p>
<p>&quot;Is any one of them from Mr. Blake-Gordon, my dear?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; replied Mary. And no one but herself knew what it cost her to have to
say it; or how trying to her was the usual silence that followed the answer.</p>
<p>&quot;I will end the suspense,&quot; she said to herself, shutting herself in her own
sitting-room when the meal was over. &quot;It is Sir Richard, I know; not William:
but at least they shall not find me willing to enter the family on bare
sufferance. I will give them the opportunity of retiring from the engagement--if
that be what they wish for.&quot;</p>
<p>Drawing her desk towards her, she paused with the pen in her hand,
deliberating how to write. Whether in a cold formal strain, or affectionately
and confidently as of yore: and she decided on the latter.</p>
<br>

<p><span class="sc">&quot;My Dearest William,</span></p>
<p>&quot;My circumstances have so changed since the early days of our engagement,
that I feel I am now, in writing to you, adopting the only course left open to
me, both in fairness to you and for the sake of my own future happiness and
peace of mind.</p>
<p>&quot;When you proposed to me and I accepted you, I was in a very different
position from that of to-day. Then I was supposed to be--nay, I supposed
myself--a very rich woman. I was the daughter of a man beloved, honoured, and
respected; a member of a house which, if not equal to your own in the past
annals of the country, might at least mix with it on equality and hold its own
amongst gentlemen. All this is now changed. My dear father is no more, my large
fortune is gone, and I am left with next to nothing.</p>
<p>&quot;That you have asked me to become your wife for myself alone, I feel sure of.
I am certain that no thought of riches influenced you in your choice: that you
would take me now as willingly as in the old days. But instinct--or presentiment
tells me that others will step in to interfere between us, and to enjoin a
separation. Should this be the case--should your father's consent, once given,
now be withdrawn--then all must be at an end between us, and I will restore you
your liberty. Without the fall approval of Sir Richard, you cannot attempt to
marry me; neither should I, without it, consent to become your wife.</p>
<p>&quot;If, on the other hand, that approval is still held out to us both as freely
as of yore, I have only to add what you know so well--that I am yours, now as
ever.</p>
<p style="text-indent:50%">&quot;<span class="sc">Mary Ursula Castlemaine</span>.&quot;</p>
<br>

<p>The letter written, she hesitated no longer about the necessity or wisdom of
the step. Sealing it, she despatched it by a trusty messenger to Sir Richard's
house just beyond the town.</p>
<p>The news of the failure of the bank and death of its master, had reached Sir
Richard Blake-Gordon when he was at a dinner party. It fell upon him with
startling effect. For a moment he felt half paralyzed: and then the blood once
more took its free course through his veins as he remembered that his son's
marriage was yet a thing of the future.</p>
<p>&quot;Never,&quot; he said to himself with energy. &quot;Never, as long as I live. I may
have a battle with William; but I could always twist him round my fingers. In
that respect he is his poor mother all over. No such weakness about me. Failed
for millions! Good heavens, what an escape! We shall be quite justified in
breaking with the daughter; and she and William have both sense enough to see
it.&quot;</p>
<p>He was not of those who put off disagreeable things until they will be put
off no longer. That very night, meeting his son when he got home, he began,
after expressing regret for the banker's sudden death.</p>
<p>&quot;A sad affair about the bank! Who would have expected it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who, indeed!&quot; returned William Blake-Gordon. &quot;Everyone thought the bank as
safe as the Bank of England. Safer, if anything.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It only shows how subject, more or less, all private concerns are to
fluctuations--changes--failures--and what not,&quot; continued Sir Richard.</p>
<p>&quot;Whatever this may be--failure or not--it will at least be open and
straightforward,&quot; said William. &quot;Mr. Peter Castlemaine was the soul of honour.
The embarrassments must have arisen from other quarters, and Thomas Hill says
the trouble and anxiety have killed him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Poor man! People are expecting it to be an awful failure. Not five shillings
in the pound for the creditors, and all the Castlemaine family ruined. This must
terminate your engagement.&quot;</p>
<p>The sudden mandate fell on the young man's ears with a shock. He thought at
the first moment his father must be jesting.</p>
<p>&quot;It must terminate my engagement?&quot; he retorted, catching sight of the dark
stern countenance. &quot;What, give up Mary Castlemaine? Never, father! Never will I
do it so long as I shall live.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, you will,&quot; said Sir Richard, quietly. &quot;I cannot allow you to sacrifice
your prospects in life.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To give her up would be to sacrifice all the prospects I care for.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tush, William!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Think what it is you would advise, sir!&quot; spoke the son with ill-suppressed
emotion. &quot;Putting aside my own feelings, think of the dishonour to my name! I
should be shunned by all good and true men; I should shun myself. Why, I would
not live through such dishonour.&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Richard took a pinch of snuff.</p>
<p>&quot;These misfortunes only render it the more urgent for me to carry out the
engagement, sir. Is it possible that you do not see it? Mary Castlemaine's
happiness is, I believe, bound up in me; and mine, I freely avow it, is in hers.
Surely, father, you would not part us!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Listen, William,&quot; spoke Sir Richard, in the calm, stern tones he could
assume at will, more telling, more penetrating than the loudest passion. &quot;Should
Miss Castlemaine become portionless--as I believe it will turn out she has
become--you cannot marry her. Or, if you do, it would be with my curse. I would
not advise you, for your own sake, to invoke that. You can look elsewhere for a
wife: there are numbers of young women as eligible as ever was Miss
Castlemaine.&quot;</p>
<p>Long they talked together, far on into the night, the stern tones on the one
hand becoming persuasive ones; the opposition sinking into silence. When they
separated, Sir Richard felt that he had three parts gained his point.</p>
<p>&quot;It is all right,&quot; said he mentally, as he stalked up to bed with his candle.
&quot;William was always ultra dutiful.&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Richard interdicted his son's visits to Miss Castlemaine; and the one or
two scant calls the young man made on her, were made in disobedience. But this
state of things could not last. William Blake-Gordon, with his yielding nature,
had ever possessed a rather exaggerated idea of the duty a son owes his father:
moreover, he knew instinctively that Mary would never consent to marry in
opposition to Sir Richard, even though he brought himself to do it.</p>
<p>It soon became known abroad that Miss Castlemaine's fortune had certainly
been sacrificed. Sir Richard was cold and distant to his son, the young man
miserable.</p>
<p>One day the baronet returned to the charge; intending his mandate to be
final. They were in the library. William's attitude was one of utter dejection
as he leaned against the side of the window, looking forth on the spring
sunshine: sunshine that brought no gladness for him. He saw too clearly what the
end would be: that his own weakness, or his sense of filial duty, call it which
you may, must give way before the stronger will, the commanding nature.</p>
<p>&quot;Your conduct is now simply cruel to Miss Castlemaine,&quot; Sir Richard was
saying. &quot;You are keeping her all this time in suspense. Or, perhaps--worse
still--allowing her to cherish the hope that her altered circumstances will not
cause the engagement to terminate.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can't help it,&quot; replied William. &quot;The engagement has no business to
terminate. It was sacredly entered into: and, without adequate reason, it ought
to be as sacredly kept.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are a living representation of folly,&quot; cried Sir Richard. &quot;Adequate
reason! There's reason enough for breaking off fifty engagements. Can you not
see the matter in its proper light?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That is what I do see,&quot; replied William, sadly. &quot;I see that the engagement
ought to be maintained. For my own part, I never can go to Mary and tell her
that I am to give her up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Coward,&quot; said Sir Richard, with a great frown. &quot;Then I must.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I fear you are right,&quot; returned William: &quot;a coward I am, little better. It
is a cowardly thing to break off this alliance--the world will call it by a very
different name. Father,&quot; he added, appealingly, &quot;is my happiness nothing to you?
Can you sacrifice us both to your pride and vainglory.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You will see it very differently some day,&quot; returned Sir Richard. &quot;When you
have lived in the world as long as I have, you will laugh at yourself for these
ridiculously romantic ideas. Instead of marring your happiness, I am making it.
Substantially, too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think, sir,&quot; said Mr. Blake-Gordon, not liking the tone, &quot;that you might
leave me to be the judge of what is best for my own happiness.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There you are mistaken, my dear William. You have but a young head on your
shoulders: you see things de tort et de travers, as the French have it. The
engagement with Peter Castlemaine's daughter would never have received my
sanction but for her great wealth. We are poor, and it is essential that you
should marry a large fortune if you marry at all. That wealth of hers has now
melted, and consequently the contract is at an end. This is the common-sense
view of the circumstances which the world will take. Done, it must be, William.
Shall I see the young lady for you? or will you be a man and see her for
yourself?&quot;</p>
<p>But before Mr. Blake-Gordon had time to reply, a note was brought in. It was
the one written by Miss Castlemaine; and it could not have arrived more
seasonably for Sir Richard's views. The young man opened it; read it to the end:
and passed it to his father in silence.</p>
<p>&quot;A very sensible girl, upon my word,&quot; exclaimed Sir Richard, when he had
mastered the contents by the aid of a double eye-glass. &quot;She sees things in
their right light. Castlemaine was, after all, an extremely honourable man, and
put proper notions into her. This greatly facilitates matters, William. Our path
is now quite smoothed out for us. I will myself write to her. You can do the
same, if you are so disposed. Had this only come before, what arguments it might
have saved!&quot;</p>
<p>Upon which the baronet sat down, and indited the following epistle:-- <br>

</p>
<p><span class="sc">&quot;My dear young Lady,</span></p>
<p>&quot;Your note--which my son has handed to me--has given me in one sense a degree
of pleasure; for I perceive in it traces of good sense and judgment, such as
women do not always possess.</p>
<p>&quot;You are right in supposing that under the present aspect of affairs a
marriage between yourself and Mr. Blake-Gordon would be unadvisable.&quot; (She had
supposed nothing of the sort, but it suited him to assume it.) &quot;And therefore I
concur with you in your opinion that the engagement should terminate.</p>
<p>&quot;Deeply though I regret this personally, I have yet felt it my duty to insist
upon it to my son: not only for his sake, but for your own. The very small means
I am able to spare to him render it impossible for him to take a portionless
wife, and I could never sanction a step that would drag him down to poverty and
embarrassment. I was about to write to you, or to see you, to tell you this, for
William shrank from the task, and your note has agreeably simplified what had to
be done. We cordially, though reluctantly, agree to what you have had the good
feeling to propose.</p>
<p>&quot;At all times I shall be delighted to hear of your welfare and happiness;
and, believe me, my dear Miss Castlemaine, you have not a more sincere
well-wisher than your devoted friend and servant,</p>
<p style="text-indent:50%">&quot;<span class="sc">&quot;Richard Blake-Gordon.&quot;</span></p>
<br>

<p>With much inward satisfaction the baronet folded the letter. He was wise
enough not to show it to his son; who, honourable in thought and feeling as he
was weak in nature, might have been prompted to tear it into shreds, and declare
that come good, come ill, he would stand true to his plighted word.</p>
<p>&quot;There!&quot; said Sir Richard, with a grunt of relief, as he affixed his seal, &quot;I
have accomplished that task for you, William. As I said before, write to her
yourself if you will, but be quick about it. In half an hour I shall send back
my answer.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Give me that time to myself,&quot; said William, rising to leave the room. &quot;If I
have anything to say I will write it.&quot;</p>
<p>At the end of the half-hour he had written the following words; and the note
was despatched with his father's:--</p>
<br>

<p><span class="sc">&quot;My Darling</span>, I suppose we must separate; but all
happiness for me is over in this world. You will, however, accord me a final
interview; a moment for explanation; I cannot part without that. I will be with
you this afternoon at four o'clock.</p>
<p style="text-indent:20%">&quot;In spite of all,</p>
<p style="text-indent:25%">&quot;I am for ever yours--and yours only,</p>
<p style="text-indent:60%">&quot;WILLIAM.&quot;</p>
<br>

<p>Unlike his father's letter, there was no hypocrisy in this, no stupid form of
words. When he wrote that all happiness for him was over, he meant it; and he
wrote truly. Perhaps he deserved no less: but, if he merited blame, judgment
might accord him some pity with it.The afternoon was drawing to itsWhen Mary
received the letters, she felt certain of their contents before a word was seen.
Sir Richard would not himself have written but to break off the engagement. He
had not even called upon her in all these long weary days of desolation and
misery: and there could be but one motive for this unkind neglect. His note
would now explain it.</p>
<p>But when she came to read its contents: its hollow hypocrisy, its plausible,
specious argument, its profession of friendship and devotion; the pang of the
death-blow gave place to the highest anger and indignation.</p>
<p>At that moment of bitterness the letter sounded to her desperately hollow and
cruel, worse perhaps than it even was. The pain was more than her wounded
spirit--so tried in the past few weeks--could bear; and with a brief but violent
storm of sobs, with which no tears came, she tore the letter in two and threw it
into the fire.</p>
<p>&quot;At least he might have done it differently,&quot; she said to herself in her
anguish. &quot;He might have written in a manner that would have made me feel it
less.&quot;</p>
<p>It was one of her first lessons in the world's harshness, in the selfish
nature of man. Happy for her if in her altered circumstances she had not many
such to learn!</p>
<p>Presently, when she had grown a little calm, she opened the other note,
almost wondering whether it would be a repetition of the cool falsity of Sir
Richard's. Ah no, no!</p>
<p>&quot;I will see him,&quot; she said, when she read the few words. &quot;But the interview
shall be brief. Of what use to prolong the agony?&quot; So when William Blake-Gordon,
true to his appointment, reached the bank at four o'clock, he was admitted.</p>
<p>How different an aspect the house presented from the bustle and the sociality
of the days gone by! A stillness, as of a dead city, reigned. Rooms that had
re-echoed with merry voices and light footsteps above, with the ring of gold and
the tones of busy men below, were now silent and deserted. No change of any kind
had yet been made in the household arrangements, but that was soon to come. The
servants would be discharged, the costly furniture was already marked for the
hammer; Mrs. Webb must leave, and--what was to be the course of Miss
Castlemaine? She had not even asked herself the question, while the engagement
with Mr. Blake-Gordon remained officially unbroken.</p>
<p>The butler opened the door to him and ushered him into the drawing-room. Mary
came forward to greet him with her pale, sad face--a face that startled her
lover. He clasped her to him, and she burst into sobs and tears. There are
moments of anguish when pride gives way.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, my darling!&quot; he cried, scarcely less agitated than herself, &quot;you are
feeling this cruel decision almost unto death! Why did you write that
letter?--why did you not remain firm?--and thereby tacitly insist on our
engagement being fulfilled?&quot;</p>
<p>Never had his weakness of nature been more betrayed than then. &quot;Why did not
<i>she</i> insist?&quot;--as if conscious that he was powerless to do it! She felt it
keenly: she felt that in this, at least, a gulf lay between them.</p>
<p>&quot;What I have done is for the best,&quot; she said, gently disengaging herself, and
suppressing the signs of her emotion, as she motioned him to a seat. &quot;In my
altered circumstances I felt--at least I feared--that no happiness could await
our marriage. Your father, in the first place, would never have given his
consent.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There are times when duty to a father should give place to duty to one's
self,&quot; he returned, forgetting how singularly this argument was contradicted by
his own conduct. &quot;All my happiness in life is over.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As you wrote to me,&quot; she said. &quot;But by-and-by, when you shall have forgotten
all this, William, and time has brought things round, you will meet with some
one who will be able to make you happy: perhaps as much so as I should have
done: and you will look back on these days as a dream.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mary!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And it will be better so.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you?&quot; he asked, with a stifled groan of remorse.</p>
<p>&quot;I?&quot; she returned, with a smile half sad, half derisive. &quot;I am nobody now.
You have a place to fill in the world; I shall soon be heard of no more.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But where are you going to live, Mary? You have nothing left out of the
wreck.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have a little. Enough for my future wants. At present I shall go on a
visit to Greylands' Rest. My uncle urges it, and he is the nearest
representative of my father. Depend upon it, I shall meet with some occupation
in life that will make me contented if not happy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Until you marry,&quot; he said. &quot;Marry some man more noble than I; more worthy of
you.&quot;</p>
<p>For a moment she looked steadily at him, and then her face flushed hot with
pain. But she would not contradict it. She began to think that she had never
quite understood the nature of Mr. Blake-Gordon.</p>
<p>&quot;In the future, you and I will probably not meet often, William; if at all,&quot;
she resumed. &quot;But you will carry with you my best wishes, and I shall always
rejoice to hear of your happiness and prosperity. The past we must, both of us,
try to forget.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I shall never forget it,&quot; was the impulsive answer.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you remember my dream?&quot; she sadly asked. &quot;The one I told you of that ball
night. How strangely it is being fulfilled! And, do you know, I think that
beautiful Dresden vase, that papa broke, must have been an omen of the evil in
store for the house.&quot;</p>
<p>He stood up now, feeling how miserable it all was, feeling his own
littleness. For a short while longer they talked together: but Mary wished the
interview over.</p>
<p>When it came to the actual parting she nearly broke down. It was very hard
and bitter. Her life had not so long ago promised to be so bright! Now all was
at an end. As to marriage--never for her: of that kind of happiness the future
contained none. Calmness, patience in suffering, resignation, and in time even
contentment, she might find in some path of duty; but beyond that, nothing.</p>
<p>They stood close together, her hands held in his, their hearts aching with
pain and yearning, each to each, with that sad yearning that is born of utter
hopelessness. A parting like this seems to be more cruel than the parting of
death.</p>
<p>&quot;Come what may, Mary, I shall love you, and you alone, to the end. You tell
me I shall marry: it may be so; I know not: but if so, my wife, whomsoever she
may be, will never have my love; never, never. We do not love twice in a
lifetime. And, if those who have loved on earth are permitted to meet in Heaven,
you and I, my best and dearest, shall assuredly find together in Eternity the
happiness denied us here.&quot;</p>
<p>She was but mortal, after all; and the words sent a strange thrill of
pleasure through her heart. Ah, no! he would never love another as he had loved
her; she knew it: and it might be--it might be--that they should recognise each
other in the bliss of a never-ending Hereafter!</p>
<p>And so they parted, each casting upon the other a long, last, lingering look,
just as Mary had already imagined in her foreboding dream.</p>
<p>That evening, as Miss Castlemaine was sitting alone, musing on the past, the
present, and the future, nursing her misery and her desolation, the door opened
and Thomas Hill was shown in. She had seen more of him than of any one else,
save Mrs. Webb, since the ruin.</p>
<p>&quot;Miss Mary,&quot; said he, when they had shaken hands, &quot;I've come to ask you
whether the report can be true?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What report?&quot; inquired Mary: but a suspicion of what he must mean rushed
over her, ere the words had well passed her lips.</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps it is hardly a report,&quot; said the clerk, correcting himself; &quot;for I
doubt if any one else knows of it. I met Sir Richard to-day, my dear young
lady,&quot; he continued, advancing and taking her hands, his tone full of indignant
commiseration; &quot;and in answer to some remark I made about your marriage, he said
the marriage was not to take place; it was at an end. I did not believe him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is quite true,&quot; replied Mary, with difficulty controlling her voice. &quot;I
am glad that it is at an end.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Glad?&quot; he repeated, looking into her face with his kindly old eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. It is much better so. Sir Richard, in the altered state of my fortunes,
would never think me a sufficiently good match for his son.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But the honour, Miss Mary! Or rather the <i>dis</i>honour of their breaking
it off! And your happiness? Is that not to be thought of?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All things that are wrong will right themselves,&quot; she replied with a quiet
smile. &quot;At least, Sir Richard thinks so.</p>
<p>&quot;And Mr. Blake-Gordon, is he willing to submit to the separation quietly?
Pardon me, Miss Mary. If your father were alive, I should know my place too well
to say a word on the subject: but--but I seem to have been drawn very close to
you since that time of desolation, and my heart resents all slight on you as <i>
he</i> would have resented it. I could not rest until I knew the truth.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Say no more about it,&quot; breathed Mary. &quot;Let the topic be between us as one
that had never had existence. It will be for my happiness.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But can nothing be done?&quot; persisted Thomas Hill. &quot;Should not your uncle go
and expostulate with them and expose their villainy--for I can call it by no
other name?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not for worlds,&quot; she said, hastily. &quot;It is I who have broken the engagement,
Mr. Hill; not they. I wrote this morning and restored Mr. Blake-Gordon his
freedom: this afternoon I bade him farewell for ever. It is all over and done
with: never mention it again to me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you--what are your plans for the future?--And, oh, forgive me for being
anxious, my dear young lady! I had you on my knee often as a little one, and in
my heart you have been as dear to me and seemed to grow up as my own daughter.
Where shall you live?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot yet tell where. I am poor, you know,&quot; she added, with one of her
sweet, sad smiles. &quot;For the present I am going on a visit to my Uncle James.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Greylands' Rest would be your most suitable home now,&quot; spoke Thomas Hill
slowly and dubiously. &quot;But--I don't know that you would like it. Mrs.
Castlemaine----&quot;</p>
<p>He stopped, hardly liking to say what was in his mind--that Mrs. Castlemaine
was not the most desirable of women to live with. Mary understood him.</p>
<p>&quot;Only on a visit,&quot; she said. &quot;While there, I shall have leisure to think of
the future. My hundred and fifty pounds a year--and that much you all say will
be secured to me----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And the whole of what I possess, Miss Mary.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My hundred and fifty pounds a year will seem as a sufficient income to me,
once I have brought my mind down from its heights,&quot; she continued, with another
faint smile, as though unmindful of the interruption. &quot;Trust me, my dear old
friend, the future shall not be as gloomy as, by the expression of your face,
you seem to anticipate. I am not weak enough to throw away my life in repining,
and in wishing for what Heaven sees fit to deny me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Heaven?&quot; he repeated in an accent of reproof.</p>
<p>&quot;Let us say circumstances, then. But in the very worst fate, it may be, that
Heaven's hand may be working--overruling all for our eventual good. My future
life can be a useful one; and I, if not happy, at least contented.&quot;</p>
<p>But that night, in the solitude of her chamber, she opened a small box,
containing nothing but a few faded white rose-leaves. It was the first trembling
offering William Blake-Gordon had given her, long before he dared to tell of his
love. Before they were again put away out of sight, tears, bitter as any shed in
her whole life, had fallen upon them. </p>

<h4><a name="div1_11" href="#div1Ref_11">CHAPTER XI.</a></h4>
<h5>INSIDE THE NUNNERY.</h5>
<br>

<p>The time had gone on at Greylands; and its great theme of excitement, the
disappearance of Anthony Castlemaine, was an event of the past. Not an iota of
evidence had arisen to tell how he disappeared: but an uneasy suspicion of Mr.
Castlemaine lurked in corners. John Bent had been the chief instigator in this.
As truly as he believed the sun shone in the heavens, so did he believe that
Anthony Castlemaine had been put out of the way by his uncle; sent out of the
world, in fact, that the young man might not imperil his possession of
Greylands' Rest. He did not say to the public, in so many words, Mr. Castlemaine
has killed his nephew; that might not have been prudent; but the bent of his
conviction could not be mistaken; and when alone with his wife he scrupled not
to talk freely. All Greylands did not share in the opinion. The superstitious
villagers attributed the disappearance to be due in some unconjectural manner to
the dreaded spirit of the Grey Monk, haunting the Friar's Keep. The fears of the
place were augmented tenfold. Not one would go at night in sight of it, save on
the greatest compulsion; and Commodore Teague (a brave, fearless man, as was
proved by his living so near the grim building alone) had whispered that the
Grey Friar was abroad again with his lamp, for he had twice seen him glide past
the casements. What with one fear and another, Greylands was not altogether in a
state of calmness.</p>
<p>Mary Ursula had come to Greylands' Rest. The once happy home at Stilborough
was given up, the furniture sold: and the affairs of the bank were virtually
settled. A sufficient sum had been saved from the wreck to bring her in about a
hundred and fifty pounds per annum; that income was secured to her for life and
would be at her disposal at death. All claims were being paid to the uttermost
shilling; liberal presents were given to the clerks and servants thrown suddenly
out of employment; and not a reproach, or shadow of it, could be cast on the
house of Castlemaine.</p>
<p>Before Mary had been a week at Greylands' Rest, she was mentally forming her
plans for leaving it. Mr. Castlemaine would fain have kept her there always: he
was loud and proud of her; he thought there was no other woman like her in the
world. Not so Mrs. Castlemaine. She resented her husband's love and reverence
for his niece; and she, little-minded, fall of spite, was actually jealous of
her. She had always felt a jealousy of the banker's daughter, living in her
luxurious home at Stilborough, keeping the high society that Mrs. Castlemaine
did not keep; she had a shrewd idea that she herself, with her little tempers,
and her petty frivolities, was sometimes compared unfavourably with Mary Ursula
by her husband, wife though she was; and she had far rather some disagreeable
animal had taken up its abode at Greylands' Rest for good, than this grand,
noble, beautiful girl. Now and again even in those first few days, she contrived
to betray this feeling: and it may be that this served to hasten Mary's plans.
Flora, too, was a perpetual source of annoyance to everybody but her mother; and
the young lady was as rude to Miss Castlemaine as to other people.</p>
<p>Since her parting with Mr. Blake-Gordon, an idea had dawned upon and been
growing in Mary Ursula's mind. It was, that she should join the sisterhood of
the Grey Ladies. The more she dwelt upon it, the greater grew her conviction
that it would be just the life now suited to her. Unlike Mr. Castlemaine, she
had always held the sisters in reverence and respect. They were self-denying;
they led a useful life before Heaven; they were of no account in the world: what
better career could she propose, or wish, for herself, now that near and dear
social ties were denied her? And she formed her resolution: though she almost
dreaded to impart it to her uncle.</p>
<p>Mr. Castlemaine stood one morning at the window of his study, looking out on
the whitened landscape, for snow covered the ground. The genial weather that
came in so early had given place to winter again: not often is spring so
changeable as they had it that year. The sad, worn look that might be seen
lately on the Master of Greylands' face, though rarely when in company, sat on
it now. He pushed his dark hair from his brow with a hasty hand, as some
thought, worse than the rest, disturbed him, and a heavy groan escaped his lips.
Drowning it with a cough, for at that moment somebody knocked at the study door,
he held his breath but did not answer. The knock came again, and he did not know
the knock: certainly it was not Miles's.</p>
<p>He strode to open the door with a frown. It was an understood thing in the
house that this room was sacred to its master. There stood Mary, in her deep
mourning.</p>
<p>&quot;I have ventured to come to you here, Uncle James,&quot; she said, &quot;as I wish to
speak with you alone. Can you spare me some minutes?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Any number to you, Mary. And remember, my dear, that <i>you</i> are always
welcome here.&quot;</p>
<p>He gave her a chair, shut down his bureau and locked it, and took a seat
himself. For a moment she paused, and then began in some hesitation.</p>
<p>&quot;Uncle James, I have been forming my plans.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Plans?&quot; he echoed.</p>
<p>&quot;And I have come to tell them to you before I tell any one else.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well?&quot; said Mr. Castlemaine, wondering what was coming.</p>
<p>&quot;I should like--I must have some occupation in life, you know?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Occupation? Well?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And I have not been long in making up my mind what it shall be. I shall join
the Sisterhood.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Join the what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Sisters at the Grey Nunnery, uncle.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Castlemaine pushed back his chair in angry astonishment when the sense of
the words fully reached him. &quot;The Sisters at the Grey Nunnery!&quot; he indignantly
cried. &quot;Join those Grey women who lead such an idle, gossiping, meddling life,
that I have no patience when I think of them! Never shall you do that, Mary
Ursula!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It seems to me that you have always mistaken them, uncle,&quot; she said; &quot;have
done them wrong in your heart; They are noble women, and they are leading a
noble life----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A petty, obscure life,&quot; he interrupted.</p>
<p>&quot;It is obscure; but in its usefulness and self-sacrifice it must be noble.
What would Greylands be without their care?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A great deal better than with it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They help the poor, they tend the sick, they teach the young ones; they try
to make the fishermen think a little of God. Who would do it if they were not
here, uncle? Do you know, I have thought so much of it in the past few days that
I <i>long</i> to join them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is utter folly!&quot; cried Mr. Castlemaine; and he had never felt so
inclined to be angry with his niece. &quot;To join this meddling Sisterhood would be
to sacrifice all your future prospects in life.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have no prospects left to sacrifice,&quot; returned Mary. &quot;You know that, Uncle
James.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No prospects? Nonsense! Because that dishonourable rascal, William
Blake-Gordon, has chosen to forfeit his engagement, and make himself a by-word
in the mouths of men, are you to renounce the world? Many a better gentleman
than he, my dear, will be seeking you before a few months have gone by.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I shall never marry,&quot; was her firm answer. &quot;Never, never. Whether I joined
the Sisters, or not; whether I retired from the world, or mixed to my dying day
in all its pomps and gaieties; still I should never marry. So you see, Uncle
James, I have now to make my future, and to create for myself an object in
life.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, we'll leave the question of marrying. Meanwhile your present home must
be with me, Mary Ursula. I cannot spare you. I should like you to make up your
mind to stay in it always, unless other and nearer ties shall call you forth.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are very kind, Uncle James; you always have been kind. But I--I must be
independent,&quot; she added with a smile and a slight flush. &quot;Forgive the seeming
ingratitude, uncle dear.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very independent you would be, if you joined those living-by-rule women!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In one sense I should be thoroughly independent, uncle. My income will be
most welcome to them, for they are, as you know, very poor----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<i>Your</i> income!&quot; he interrupted, half scoffingly. &quot;I wish--I <i>wish</i>,
Mary--you would allow me to augment it!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And I shall be close to Greylands' Rest,&quot; she continued, with a slight shake
of the head, for this proposal to settle money upon her had become quite a
vexations question. &quot;I shall be able to come here to see you often.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mary Ursula, I will hear no more of this,&quot; he cried, quite passionately.
&quot;You shall never do it with my consent.&quot;</p>
<p>She rose and laid her pleading hands upon his. &quot;Uncle, pardon me, but my mind
is made up. I have not decided hastily, or without due consideration. By day and
by night I have dwelt upon it--I--I have <i>prayed</i> over it, uncle--and I
plainly see it is the best thing for me. I would sooner spend my days there than
anywhere, because I shall be near you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And I want you to be near me. But not in a nunnery.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is not a nunnery now you know, Uncle James, though the building happens
still to bear the name. If I take up my abode there, I take no vows, remember. I
do not renounce the world. Should any necessity arise--though I think it will
not--for me to resume my place in society, I am at full Liberty to put off my
grey gown and bonnet and do so.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you think your father would have said to this, Mary Ursula?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Were my father alive, Uncle James, the question never could have arisen; my
place would have been with him. But I think--if he could see me now under all
these altered circumstances--I think he would say to me Go.&quot;</p>
<p>There was no turning her. James Castlemaine saw it: and when she quitted the
room he felt that the step, unless some special hindrance intervened, would be
carried out.</p>
<p>&quot;The result of being clever enough to have opinions of one's own!&quot; muttered
Mr. Castlemaine, in reference to the, to him, most unwelcome project.</p>
<p>Turning to the window again, he stood there, looking out. Looking out, but
seeing nothing. The Friar's Keep opposite, rising dark and grim from contrast
with the intervening white landscape; the sparkling blue sea beyond, glittering
in the frosty sunshine: he saw none of it. The snow must be blinding his sight,
or some deep trouble his perceptive senses. Mr. Castlemaine had other motives
than the world knew of for wishing to keep his niece out of the Grey Nunnery:
but he did not see how it was to be done.</p>
<p>Mary Ursula had passed into her own chamber: the best room in the house, and
luxuriously furnished. It was generally kept for distinguished guests; and Mrs.
Castlemaine had thought a plainer one might have served the young lady, their
relative; but, as she muttered resentfully to the empty air, if Mr. Castlemaine
could load the banker's daughter with gold and precious stones, he'd go out of
his way to do it.</p>
<p>Drawing her chair to the fire, Mary sat down and thought out her plan. And
the longer she dwelt upon it, the more did she feel convinced that she was right
in its adoption. A few short weeks before, and had any Nunnery and become one of
the Grey Sisters, she had started back in aversion. But ideas change with
circumstances. Then she had a happy home of splendour, an indulgent father,
riches that seemed unbounded at command, the smiles of the gay world, and a
lover to whom she was shortly to be united. Now she had none of these: all had
been wrested from her at one fell swoop. To the outward world she had seemed to
take her misfortunes calmly: but none knew how they had wrung her very soul. It
had seemed to her that her heart was broken: it seemed to her as though some
retired and quiet place to rest in were absolutely needful while she recovered,
if she ever did recover, the effects of these calamities. But she did not want
to sit down under her grief and nourish it: she had prayed earnestly, and did
still pray, that it would please Heaven to enable her to find consolation in her
future life, and that it might be one of usefulness to others, as it could not
be one of happiness to herself. But a latent prevision sometimes made itself
apparent, that happiness would eventually come; that in persevering in her
laid-out path, she should find it.</p>
<p>&quot;The sooner I enter upon it, the better,&quot; she said, rising from her chair and
shaking out the crape folds of her black silk dress. &quot;And there's nothing to
wait for, now that I have broken it to my uncle.&quot;</p>
<p>Glancing at her own face as she passed a mirror, she halted to look at the
change that trouble had made in it. Others might not notice it, but to herself
it was very perceptible. The beautiful features were thinner than of yore, the
cheeks bore a fainter rose-colour; her stately form had lost somewhat of its
roundness. Ah, it was not her own sorrow that had mostly told upon Mary
Castlemaine; it was the sudden death of her father, and the agonizing doubt
attending on it.</p>
<p>&quot;If I could but know that it was God's will that he should die!&quot; she
exclaimed, raising her hands in an attitude of supplication. &quot;And there's that
other dreadful trouble--that awful doubt--about poor Anthony!&quot;</p>
<p>Descending the stairs, she opened the door of the red parlour, and entered on
a scene of turbulence. Miss Flora was in one of her most spiteful and provoking
humours. She was trying to kick Ethel, who held her at arms' length. Her pretty
face was inflamed, her pretty hair hung wild--and Flora's face and hair were
both as pretty as they could well be.</p>
<p>&quot;Flora!&quot; said Miss Castlemaine, advancing to the rescue. &quot;Flora, for shame!
Unless I had seen you in this passion, I had not believed it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I <i>will</i> kick her, then! It's through her I did not go with mamma in
the carriage to Stilborough .&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was mamma who would not take you,&quot; said Ethel. &quot;She said she had some
private business there, and did not want you with her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She would have taken me: you know she would; but for your telling her I had
not done my French exercise, you ugly, spiteful thing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mamma asked me whether you had done it, and I said no.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you ought to have said yes! You ill-natured, wicked, interfering
dromedary!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Be still, Flora,&quot; interposed Miss Castlemaine. &quot;Unless you are, I will call
your papa. How can you so forget yourself?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<i>You</i> have no business to interfere, Mary Ursula! The house is not
yours; you are only staying in it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;True,&quot; said Miss Castlemaine, calmly. &quot;And I shall not be very much longer
in it, Flora. I am going away soon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I shall be glad of that,&quot; retorted the rude child; &quot;and I am sure mamma will
be. She says it is a shame that you should be let take up the best bedroom.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Flora!&quot; interposed Ethel.</p>
<p>&quot;And she says----&quot;</p>
<p>What further revelations the damsel might be contemplating, in regard to her
mother, were summarily cut short. Harry Castlemaine had entered in time to hear
what she was saying, and he quietly lifted her from the room. Outside, he
treated her to what she dreaded, though it was not often she got it from him--a
severe shaking--and she ran away howling.</p>
<p>&quot;She is being ruined,&quot; said Harry. &quot;Mrs. Castlemaine never corrects her, or
allows her to be corrected. I wish my father would take it seriously in hand!
She ought to be at school.&quot;</p>
<p>Peace restored, Mary told them what she had just been telling Mr.
Castlemaine. She was about to become a Grey Sister. Harry laughed: he did not
believe a syllable of it; Ethel, more clear-sighted, burst into tears.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't, don't leave us!&quot; she whispered, clinging to Mary, in her astonishment
and distress. &quot;You see what my life is here! I am without love, without
sympathy. I have only my books and my music and my drawings and the sea! but for
them my heart would starve. Oh, Mary; it has been so different since you came: I
have had you to love.&quot;</p>
<p>Mary Ursula put her arm round Ethel. She herself standing in so much need of
love, had felt the tender affection of this fresh young girl, already entwining
itself around her heart, as the grateful tree feels the tendrils of the clinging
vine.</p>
<p>&quot;You will be what I shall most regret in leaving Greylands' Rest, Ethel. But,
my dear, we can meet constantly. You can see me at the Nunnery when you will;
and I shall come here sometimes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Look here, Mary Ursula,&quot; said Harry, all his lightness checked. &quot;Sooner than
you should go to that old Nunnery, I'll burn it down.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, you will not, Harry.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I will. The crazy old building won't be much loss to the place, and the
ruins would be picturesque.&quot;</p>
<p>He was so speaking only to cover his real concern. The project was no less
displeasing to him than to his father.</p>
<p>&quot;You do not mean this, Mary Ursula!&quot; But the grave look of her earnest face
effectually answered him.</p>
<p>&quot;It is I who shall miss you,&quot; bewailed Ethel. &quot;Oh, can nothing be done?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing,&quot; said Mary, smiling. &quot;Our paths, Ethel, will probably lie far apart
in life. You will marry, and social ties will form about you. I----&quot; she broke
off suddenly.</p>
<p>&quot;I intend to marry Ethel myself,&quot; said Harry, kicking hack a large live coal
that flew far out into the hearth.</p>
<p>&quot;Be quiet, Harry,&quot; said Ethel, a shade of annoyance in her tone.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, you know it's true,&quot; he returned, without looking at her.</p>
<p>&quot;True! When we are like brother and sister!&quot;</p>
<p>Miss Castlemaine glanced from one to the other. She did not know how to take
this. That Harry liked Ethel and was in the habit of paying her attention, told
nothing; for he did the same by many other young ladies.</p>
<p>&quot;It was only last week I asked her to fix the day,&quot; said Harry.</p>
<p>&quot;And I told you to go and talk nonsense elsewhere; not to me,&quot; retorted
Ethel, her tone betraying her real vexation.</p>
<p>&quot;If you won't have me, Ethel, you'll drive me to desperation. I might go off
and marry one of the Grey Sisters in revenge. It should be Sister Ann. She is a
charming picture; one to take a young man's heart by storm.&quot;</p>
<p>Mary Ursula looked keenly at him. In all this there was a semblance of
something not real. It struck her that he was <i>wanting to make it appear</i>
he wished for Ethel, when in fact he did not.</p>
<p>&quot;Harry,&quot; she cried, speaking upon impulse, &quot;you have not, I hope, been
falling in love with anybody undesirable?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I have,&quot; said Harry, his face flushing. &quot;Don't I tell you who it
is?--Sister Ann. Mark you though, cousin mine, <i>you</i> shall never be allowed
to make one of those Grey Sisters.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are very random, you know, Harry,&quot; said Miss Castlemaine, slowly. &quot;You
talk to young ladies without meaning anything--but they may not detect that.
Take care you do not go too far some day, and find yourself in a mesh.&quot; Harry
Castlemaine turned his bright face on his cousin. &quot;I never talk seriously but to
one person, Mary Ursula. And that's Ethel.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Harry,&quot; cried the young girl, with flashing eyes, &quot;you are not fair to me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And now, have you any commands for the Commodore?&quot; went on Harry lightly,
and taking no notice of Ethel's rebuke. &quot;I am going to the Hutt.&quot;</p>
<p>They said they had none; and he left the room. Mary turned to Ethel.</p>
<p>&quot;My dear--if you have no objection to confide in me--<i>is</i> there anything
between you and Harry?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing, Mary,&quot; was the answer, and Ethel blushed the soft blush of girlish
modesty as she said it. &quot;Last year he teased me very much, making me often
angry; but latterly he has been better. The idea of my marrying him!--when we
have grown up together like brother and sister! It would seem hardly proper. I
like Harry very much indeed as a brother; but as to marrying him, why, I'd
rather never be married at all. Here's the carriage coming back! Mamma must have
forgotten something.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Castlemaine's carriage was seen winding round the drive. They heard her
get out at the door and hold a colloquy with Flora. She came to the red parlour
looking angry.</p>
<p>&quot;Where's Harry?&quot; she demanded, in the sharp, unkindly tones that so often
grated on the ear of those offending her, as she threw her eyes round the room.</p>
<p>&quot;Harry is not here, mamma,&quot; replied Ethel.</p>
<p>&quot;I understood he was here,&quot; suspiciously spoke Mrs. Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;He went out a minute or two ago,&quot; said Ethel. &quot;I think he is gone to
Commodore Teague's.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He is like an eel,&quot; was the pettish rejoinder. &quot;You never know when you have
him. As to that vulgar, gossiping old Teague, that they make so much of and are
always running after, I can't think what they see in him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps it is his gossip that they like,&quot; suggested Ethel.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I want Harry. He has been beating Flora.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think he beat her, mamma.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, you great story-teller!&quot; exclaimed Flora, putting in her head. &quot;He shook
me till all my bones rattled.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Castlemaine shut the door with a click. And the next that they saw, was
Miss Flora dressed in her best and going off with her mamma in the carriage.</p>
<p>&quot;With this injudicious treatment the child has hardly a chance to become
better,&quot; murmured Mary Ursula. &quot;Ethel, have you a mind for a walk?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes: with you.&quot;</p>
<p>They dressed themselves and started for the village, walking lightly over the
crisp snow, under the clear blue sky. Miss Castlemaine was bound for the Grey
Nunnery; Ethel protesting she would do no act or part towards helping her to
enter it, went off to see some of the fishermen's wives on the cliff.</p>
<p>Passing through the outer gate, Mary Ursula rang at the bell, and was
admitted by Sister Phoeby. A narrow passage took her into the hall. Opening from
it on the left hand was a moderate-sized room, plain and comfortable. It was
called the reception parlour, but was the one usually sat in by the Grey Ladies:
in fact, they had no other sitting room that could be called furnished. Dinner
was taken in a bare, bleak room, looking to the sea; it was used also as the
schoolroom, and contained chiefly a large table and some forms. Miss Castlemaine
was shown into the reception parlour. Two of the ladies were in it: Sister
Margaret writing, Sister Betsey making lint.</p>
<p>An indication of Miss Castlemaine's wish to join the Sisters had already
reached the Nunnery, and they knew not how to make enough of her. It had caused
quite a commotion of delight. To number a Castlemaine amidst them, especially
one so much esteemed, so high, and grand, and good as the banker's daughter, was
an honour hardly to be believed in; the small fortune she would bring seemed,
like riches in itself, and they coveted the companionship of the sweet and
gentle lady for their own sakes. Her joining them would swell the number of the
community to thirteen; but no reason existed against that.</p>
<p>Sister Margaret put down her pen, Sister Betsey her linen, as their visitor
entered. They gave her the one arm-chair by the fire--Sister Mildred's own
place--and Mary put back her crape veil as she sat down. Calm, quiet, good,
looked the ladies in their simple grey gowns, their hair smoothly braided under
the white cap of worked muslin; and Mary Ursula seemed to feel a foretaste of
peace in the time when the like dress, the like serene life, would be hers. The
Superior Sisters came flocking in on hearing she was there; all were present
save sister Mildred: Margaret, Charlotte, Betsey, Grizzel, and Mona. The working
Sisters were Phoeby, Ann, Rachel, Caroline, Lettice, and Ruth.</p>
<p>The ladies hastened to tell Miss Castlemaine of a hope, or rather project,
they had been entertaining--namely, that when she joined the community, she
should become its head. Sister Mildred, incapacitated by her tedious illness,
had long wished to resign control; and would have done so before, but that
Sister Margaret, on whom it ought to descend, declined to take it. Miss
Castlemaine sat in doubt: the proposal came upon her by surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;I do all the writing that has to be done, and keep the accounts; and you see
that's all I'm good for,&quot; said Sister Margaret to Miss Castlemaine, in a tone of
confidence. &quot;If I were put in Sister Mildred's place, and had to order this and
decide that, I should be lost. Why, if they came and asked me whether the dinner
for the day should consist of fresh herrings, or pork and pease-pudding, I
should never know which to say.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sister Mildred may regain her health,&quot; observed Miss Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;But she'll never regain her hearing,&quot; put in Sister Grizzel, a little quick,
fresh-coloured, talkative woman. &quot;And that tells very much against her as
Superioress. In fact, her continuing as such is like a farce.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Besides, she herself wants to give it up,&quot; said Sister Charlotte. &quot;Oh, Miss
Castlemaine, if you would but accept it in her place! You would make us happy.&quot;</p>
<p>Mary Ursula said she must take time for consideration. She was invited to go
up to Sister Mildred, who would be sure to think it a slight if she did not. So
she was conducted upstairs by the ladies, Charlotte and Mona, and found herself
in a long, dark, narrow corridor, which had doors on either side--the nuns'
cells of old. The Head Sister's room was at the extreme end--a neat little
chamber, whose casement looked out on to the sea with a small bed in a corner.
Sister Mildred was dressed and sat by the fire. She was a fair-complexioned,
pleasant-looking, talkative woman, slightly deformed, and past fifty, but still
very light and active. Of her own accord, she introduced the subject of
resigning her post to Miss Castlemaine, and pressed her urgently to take it.</p>
<p>&quot;The holding it has become a trouble to me, my dear,&quot; she said. &quot;Instead of
lying here at peace with nothing to think of--and some days I can't get up at
all--I am being referred to perpetually. Sister Margaret refuses to take it; she
says she's of more good for writing and account keeping. As to Sister Charlotte,
she is always amid the little ones in the school; she likes teaching--and so
there it is. Your taking it, my dear, would solve a difficulty; and we could
hardly let one, bearing the honoured name of Castlemaine, be among us, and not
be placed at our head.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You may get better; you may regain your health,&quot; said Mary.</p>
<p>&quot;And, please God, I shall,&quot; cheerfully returned Sister Mildred, when she
could be made to comprehend the remark. &quot;Mr. Parker tells me so. But I shall be
none the more competent for my post. My deafness has become so much worse since
health failed that that of itself unfits me for it. The Sisters will tell you
so. Why, my dear, you don't know the mistakes it leads to. I hear just the
opposite of what's really said, and give orders accordingly. Sister Margaret
wrote a letter and transacted some business all wrong through this, and it has
caused ever so much trouble to set it to rights. It is mortifying to her and to
me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To all of us,&quot; put in Sister Charlotte.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, my dear Miss Castlemaine, just look at my facility for misapprehension!
Only the other day,&quot; continued the Superioress, who dearly loved a gossip when
she could get it, &quot;Sister Ann came running up here in a flurry, her eyes
sparkling, saying Parson Marston was below. 'What, below then?' I asked. 'Yes,'
she said, 'below then,' and ran off again. I wondered what could have brought
the parson here, for we don't see him at the Nunnery from year's end to year's
end, but was grateful to him for thinking of us, and felt that I ought to get
down, if possible, to receive and thank him. So I turned out of bed and scuffled
into my petticoats, slipping on my best gown and a new cap, and down stairs I
went. Would you believe it, my dear young lady, that it was not Parson Marston
at all, but a fine sucking pig!&quot;</p>
<p>Mary could not avoid a laugh.</p>
<p>&quot;A beautiful sucking-pig, that lasted us two days when cooked. It came, a
present, from Farmer Watson, a good, grateful man, whose little boy Sister Mona
went to nurse through a fever. I had mistaken what she said, you see, and got up
for nothing. But that's the way it is with me; and the sooner I am superseded by
somebody who can hear, the better.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have said lately that you ought to change your room,&quot; cried Sister
Margaret to her. &quot;In this one you are sometimes exposed to a sharp breeze.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Cheese?&quot; returned the deaf lady, mistaking the word. &quot;Bread and cheese! By
all means order it into the parlour if Miss Castlemaine would like some. Dear
me, I am very remiss!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, no,&quot; returned Sister Margaret, laughing at the mistake, and speaking in
her ear, &quot;I only suggested it might be better for your deafness if you exchanged
this room for a warmer one: one on the other side.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is that all! Then why did you mention cheese? No, no; I am not going to
change my room. I like this one, this aspect; the sea is as good to me as a
friend. And what does Miss Castlemaine say?&quot;</p>
<p>Mary stood at the casement window. The grand, expansive sea lay below and
around. She could see nothing else. An Indiaman was sailing majestically in the
distance; on the sails of one of the fishing boats, dotting the surface nearer,
some frosted snow had gathered and was sparkling in the sunshine. There she
stood, reflecting.</p>
<p>&quot;For the sake of constantly enjoying this scene of wondrous beauty, it would
be almost worth while to come, let alone other inducements!&quot; she exclaimed
mentally in her enthusiasm. &quot;As to acceding to their wish of taking the lead, I
believe it is what I should like, what I am fitted for.&quot;</p>
<p>And when she quitted Sister Mildred's room she left her promise of
acceptation within it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile an unpleasant adventure had just happened to Ethel. Her visits to
the wives of the fishermen on the cliff concluded, and seeing no sign yet of
Mary Ursala's leaving the Nunnery, she thought she would make a call on Mrs.
Bent, and wait there: which, in truth, she was rather fond of doing. But to-day
she arrived at an inopportune moment. Mr. and Mrs. Bent were enjoying a dispute.</p>
<p>It appeared that a letter had been delivered at the inn that morning,
addressed to Anthony Castlemaine: the third letter that had come for him since
his disappearance. The two first bore the postmark of Gap, this one the London
postmark, and all were addressed in the same handwriting.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bent had urged her husband to hand over the others to the Master of
Greylands: she was now urging the like as to this one. John Bent, though in most
matters under his wife's finger and thumb, had wholly refused to listen to her
in this: he should keep the letters in his own safe custody, he said, until the
writer, or some one of Mr. Anthony's connections from over the water, appeared
to claim them.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bent was unable to stir his decision: since the fatal night connected
with the Friar's Keep, she could but notice that John had altered. He was more
silent than of yore; yielded to her less, and maintained his own will better:
which was, of course, not an agreeable change to Mrs. Bent.</p>
<p>They were in their ordinary room, facing the sea. The door stood open as
usual, but a screen of two folds now intervened between the fire-place and the
draught. John sat in his carved elbow-chair; Mrs. Bent stood by, folding clothes
at the table; which was drawn near the fire from its place under the window.</p>
<p>&quot;I tell you, then, John Bent, you might be taken up and prosecuted for it,&quot;
she said, sprinkling the linen so vigorously that some splashes went on his
face. &quot;Keeping other people's letters!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The letters are directed here, to my house, Dorothy woman; and I shall keep
them till some proper person turns up to receive them,&quot; was John's answer,
delivered without irritation as he wiped his face with his pocket-handkerchief.</p>
<p>&quot;The proper person is Mr. Castlemaine. Just take your elbow away: you'll be
upsetting the basin. He is the young man's uncle.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now look here, wife. You've said that before, and once for all I tell you
I'll not do it. Mr. Castlemaine is the last person in the world I'd hand the
letters to. What would he do with them!--Put 'em in the fire, I dare be bound.
If, as I believe; I believe it to my very heart; Mr. Castlemaine took his
nephew's life that night in the Friar's Keep----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hist!&quot; said Mrs. Bent, the rosy colour on her face fading as a sound caught
her ear; &quot;hist, man!&quot;</p>
<p>And, for once, more alarmed than angry, she looked behind the screen, and
found herself face to face with Ethel Reene.</p>
<p>&quot;Mercy be good to us!&quot; she exclaimed, seeing by the young lady's white face
that they had been overheard. And, scarcely knowing what she did, she dragged
the horror-stricken girl round to the hearth, before John.</p>
<p>&quot;Now you've done it!&quot; she cried, turning upon him. &quot;You'd better pack up and
be off to jail: for if Miss Ethel tells the Master of Greylands what she has
heard, he'll put you there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, he won't,&quot; said John, full of contrition for the mischief he had done,
but nevertheless determined not to eat his words, and believing the suspicion
must have reached the young lady sooner or later.</p>
<p>&quot;You cannot think this of papa!&quot; said Ethel, sinking into a chair.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, Miss Ethel, it is a great mystery, as you must know,&quot; said the
landlord, who had risen. &quot;I think the Master of Greylands could solve it if he
liked.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But--but, Mr. Bent, what you said is most dreadful!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm heartily sorry you chanced to overhear it, Miss Ethel.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There's no cause to wink at me like that, wife. The words are said, and I
cannot unsay them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But--do--you---believe it?&quot; gasped Ethel.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, he does believe it,&quot; burst forth Mrs. Bent, losing sight of prudence in
her anger against her husband. &quot;If he does not get into some awful trouble one
of these days through his tongue, his name's not John Bent--And there's Miss
Castlemaine of Stilborough crossing over the road!&quot;</p>
<p>Not less overcome by terror and dismay than Mrs. Bent had been by anger,
Ethel rushed out of the house and burst into a storm of hysterical sobs. Mary
Ursula, wondering much and full of concern, drew her arm within her own and went
over to the little solitary bench that stood by the sea.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, my dear, tell me what this means,&quot; she said, as they sat down.</p>
<p>But Ethel hesitated: it was not a thing to be told to Miss; Castlemaine. She
stammered an incoherent word or two between her sobs, and at the best was
indistinct.</p>
<p>&quot;I understand, Ethel. Be calm. John Bent has been making a terrible charge
against my Uncle James.&quot;</p>
<p>Ethel clung to her. She admitted that it was so: telling how she had
unintentionally overheard the private conversation between the landlord and his
wife. She said it had frightened and confused her, though she did not believe
it.</p>
<p>&quot;Neither do I believe it,&quot; returned Miss Castlemaine calmly. &quot;I heard this
some time ago--I mean the suspicion that is rife in Greylands--but I am sorry
that you should have been startled with it. That my uncle is incapable of
anything of the kind--and only to have to say as much in refutation seems a
cruel insult on him--I am perfectly sure of; and I am content to wait the
elucidation that no doubt time will bring.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bat how wicked of John Bent!&quot; cried Ethel.</p>
<p>&quot;Ethel, dear, I have gone through so much misery of late that it has <i>
subdued</i> me, and I think I have learnt the great precept not to judge
another,&quot; said Mary Ursula sadly. &quot;I do not blame John Bent. I respect him. That
a strange mystery does encompass the doings of that February night--so fatal for
me as well as for poor Anthony--I cannot ignore: and I speak not now of the
disappearance only. There's reason in what John Bent says--that Mr. Castlemaine
is not open about it, that it might be fancied he knows more than he will say.
It is so. Perhaps he will not speak because it might implicate some one--not
himself, Ethel; never himself; I do not fear that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, no,&quot; murmured Ethel.</p>
<p>&quot;It is Mr. Castlemaine's pride, I think, that prevents his speaking. He must
have heard these rumours, and naturally resents them----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you think Anthony is really dead?&quot; interrupted Ethel.</p>
<p>&quot;I have never had any hope from the first that he is not. Now and then my
imagination runs away with me and suggests he may be here, he may be there, he
may have done this or done that--but of real hope, that he is alive, I have
none. Next to the death of my dear father, it has been the greatest weight I
have had to bear. I saw him but once, Ethel, but I seemed to take to him as to a
brother. I am sure he was honourable and generous, a good man and a gentleman.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You know what they are foolish enough to say here?&quot; breathed Ethel. &quot;That
the ghost of the Grey Friar, angry at his precincts being invaded----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hush!&quot; reproved Miss Castlemaine.</p>
<br>

<h4><a name="div1_12" href="#div1Ref_12">CHAPTER XII.</a></h4>
<h5>MADAME GUISE.</h5>
<br>

<p>IT was the afternoon of this same day. The stage-coach, delayed by the snow,
was very late when it was heard approaching. It's four well-fed horses drew lip
at the Dolphin Lim, to set down Mr. Nettleby. The superintendent of the
coastguard, who had been on some business a mile or two inland, had availed
himself of the coach for returning. John Bent and his wife came running to the
door. The guard, hoping, perhaps, for sixpence or a shilling gratuity, descended
from his seat, and was extending a hand to help the officer down from the roof,
when he found himself called to by a lady inside, who had been reconnoitring the
inn, and the flaming dolphin on its signboard.</p>
<p>&quot;What place is this, guard?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Greylands, ma'am.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That seems a good hotel.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is a nice comfortable inn, ma'am.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I will get out here. Please see to my luggage.&quot;</p>
<p>The guard was surprised. He thought the lady must have made a mistake.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not Stilborough, ma'am. You are booked to Stilborough.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I will not go on to Stilborough: I will descend here instead. See my
poor child&quot;--showing the hot face of a little girl who lay half asleep upon her
knee. &quot;She has, I fear, the fever coming on, and she is so fatigued. This must
be a healthy place; it has the sea, I perceive; and I think she shall rest here
for a day or two before going on.&quot;</p>
<p>The landlord and his wife had heard this colloquy, for the lady spoke at the
open window. They advanced, and the guard threw wide the door.</p>
<p>&quot;Will you carry my little one?&quot; said the lady to Mrs. Bent. &quot;I fear she is
going to be ill, and I do not care to take her on farther. Can I be accommodated
with a good apartment here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The best rooms we have, ma'am, are at your service; and you will find them
excellent, though I say it myself,&quot; returned Mrs. Bent, receiving the child into
her arms.</p>
<p>&quot;Marie fatigue,&quot; plaintively called out the little thing, who seemed about
three years old. &quot;Marie ne peut marcher.&quot;</p>
<p>The lady reassured her in the same language, and alighted. She was a tall,
ladylike young woman of apparently some six-and-twenty years, with soft, fair
hair, and a pleasing face that wore signs of care, or weariness: or perhaps
both. Mrs. Bent carried the child into the parlour; John followed with a large
hand-reticule made of plaited black-and-white straw, and the guard put two
trunks in the passage, a large one and a small one.</p>
<p>&quot;I am en voyage,&quot; said the lady, addressing Mrs. Bent--and it may be remarked
that, though speaking English with fluency, and with very little foreign accent,
she now and then substituted a French word, or a whole sentence as though the
latter were more familiar to her in everyday life--and of which John Bent and
his wife did not understand a syllable.</p>
<p>&quot;But we have voyaged far, and the sea-crossing was frightfully rough, and I
fear I have brought my little one on too quickly: so it may be well to halt here
for a short time, and keep her quiet. I hope your hotel is not crowded with
company?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There's nobody at all staying in it just now, ma'am,&quot; said Mrs. Bent. &quot;We
don't have many indoor visitors at the winter season.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And this snow is not good,&quot; said the stranger; &quot;I mean not good for
voyagers. I might have put off my journey had I thought it would come. When I
left my home, the warm spring sun was shining, and the trees were budding.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We have had fine warm weather here, too,&quot; said Mrs. Bent; &quot;it changed again
a week ago to winter: not but what we had the sun out bright to-day. This dear
little thing seems delicate, ma'am.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not generally. But she is fatigued, you see, and has a touch of fever. We
must make her some tisane.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We'll soon get her right again,&quot; said Mrs. Bent, gently; for with children,
of whom she was very fond, she lost all her sharpness. &quot;Poor little lamb! And so
you've come from over the water, ma'am!--and the sea was rough!--and did this
little one suffer?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, pray do not talk of that terrible sea! I thought I must have died. To
look at, nothing more beautiful; but to be on it--ah, Ciel!&quot;</p>
<p>She shuddered and shrugged her shoulders with the recollection. There was
something peculiarly soft and winning in the quiet tones of her voice; something
attractive altogether in her features and their sad expression.</p>
<p>&quot;I never was on the sea, thank goodness,&quot; said Mrs. Bent; &quot;I have heard it's
very bad. We get plenty of it as far as the looks go: and that's enough for us,
ma'am. Many an invitation I've had in my life to go off sailing in people's
boats--but no, not for me. One knows one's safe on land.&quot;</p>
<p>She had sat down, the child on her lap, and was taking off its blue woollen
hood and warm woollen pelisse of fleecy grey cloth. The frock underneath was of
fine black French merino. The lady wore the same kind of black dress under her
cloak: it was evident that both were in mourning. Happening to look up from the
semi-sleeping child, Mrs. Bent caught the traveller's eyes fixed attentively
upon her, as if studying her face.</p>
<p>&quot;How do you call this village, I was about to ask. Grey----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Greylands, ma'am. Stilborough is about three miles off. Are you going
there?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not to stay,&quot; said the lady, hastily. &quot;I am come to England to see a
relative, but my progress is not in any hurry. I must think first of my child:
and this air seems good.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;None so good for miles and miles,&quot; returned Mrs. Bent. &quot;A week of it will
make this little lady quite another child. Pretty thing! What beautiful eyes!&quot;</p>
<p>The child had woke up again in her restlessness; she was gazing up at her
strange nurse with wide-open, dark brown eyes. They were not her mother's eyes,
for those were blue. The hot little face was becoming paler.</p>
<p>&quot;I mist make her some tisane&quot; repeated the lady; &quot;or show you how to make it.
You have herbs, I presume. We had better get her to bed. Nothing will do her so
much good as rest and sleep. Will Marie go to bed?&quot; she said, addressing the
little girl.</p>
<p>&quot;Oui,&quot; replied the child, who appeared to understand English, but would not
speak it. &quot;Marie sommeil,&quot; she added in her childish patois. &quot;Marie soif. Maman,
donne Marie a boire.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Will you take her, ma'am, for a few moments?&quot; said Mrs. Bent, placing her in
the mother's arms. &quot;I will see after your room and make it ready.&quot;</p>
<p>The landlady left the parlour. The child, feverish and weary, soon began to
cry. Her mother hushed her; and presently, not waiting for the reappearance of
the landlady, carried her upstairs.</p>
<p>Which was the chamber? she wondered, on reaching the landing: but the
half-open door of one, and some stir within, guided her thoughts to it, as the
right. Mrs. Bent was bustling about it; and the landlord, who appeared to have
been taking up the trunks, stood just inside the door. Some kind of dispute
seemed to be going on, for Mrs. Bent's tones were shrill. The lady halted, not
liking to intrude, and sat down on a short bench against the wall; the child,
dozing again, was heavy for her.</p>
<p>&quot;As if there was not another room in the house, but you must make ready this
one!&quot; John was saying in a voice of vexed remonstrance. &quot;I told you, Dorothy,
I'd never have this chamber used again until we had not space left elsewhere.
What are you going to do with the things?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now don't you fret yourself to fiddle-strings,&quot; retorted Mrs. Bent. &quot;I am
putting all the things into this linen-basket; his clothes and his little desk
and all, even the square of scented soap he used, for he brought it with him in
his portmanteau. They shall go into the small chest in our bedroom, and be
locked up. And you may put a seal upon the top of it for safety.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I did not wish to have the things disturbed at all,&quot; urged John. &quot;The
lady might have had another room.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The tap-room is your concern, the care of the chambers is mine, and I choose
her to have this one,&quot; said independent Mrs. Bent. &quot;As to keeping the best
chamber out of use just because these things have remained in it unclaimed, is
about as daft a notion as ever I heard of. If you don't take care, John, you'll
go crazy over Anthony Castlemaine.&quot;</p>
<p>The mother outside, waiting, and hushing her child to her, had not been
paying much attention: but at the last words she started, and gazed at the door.
Her lips parted; her face turned white.</p>
<p>&quot;Peace, wife,&quot; said the landlord. &quot;What I say is right.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, crazy,&quot; persisted Mrs. Bent, who rarely dropped an argument of her own
accord. &quot;Look at what happened with Miss Ethel Reene to-day! I'm sure you are
not in your senses on the subject, John Bent, or you'd never be so imprudent.
You may believe Mr. Anthony was murdered by his uncle, but it does not do to
turn yourself into a town-crier, and proclaim it.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh, more deadly white than before did these words turn the poor lady who was
listening. Her face was as the face of one stricken with terror; her breath came
in gasps; she clutched at her child, lest her trembling hands should let it
fall. John Bent and his wife came forth, bearing between them the piled-up
clothes-basket, a small mahogany desk on its top. She let her face drop upon her
child's and kept it there, as though she too had fallen asleep.</p>
<p>&quot;Dear me, there's the lady!&quot; whispered John.</p>
<p>&quot;And it's unbeknown what <i>she</i> has overheard,&quot; muttered Mrs. Bent. &quot;I
beg your pardon, ma'am; you'll be cold sitting there. Had you dropped asleep?&quot;</p>
<p>The lady lifted her white face: fortunately the passage was in twilight: she
passed a pocket-handkerchief over her brow as she spoke.</p>
<p>&quot;My little child got so restless that I came up. Is the room ready?&quot;</p>
<p>Letting fall her handle of the basket and leaving her husband to convey it
into their chamber as he best could, Mrs. Bent took the child from the speaker's
arms and preceded her into the room. A spacious, comfortable chamber, with a
fine view over the sea, and a good fire burning up in the grate.</p>
<p>&quot;We were as quick as we could be,&quot; said Mrs. Bent, in apology for having kept
her guest waiting; &quot;but I had to empty the chamber first of some articles that
were in it. I might have given you another room at once, ma'am, for we always
keep them in readiness, you see; but this is the largest and has the pleasantest
look-out; and I thought if the little girl was to be ill, you'd like it best.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Articles belonging to a former traveller?&quot; asked the lady, who was kneeling
then before her trunk to get out her child's night-things.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, ma'am. A gentleman we had here a few short weeks ago.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And he has left?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yes,&quot; replied Mrs. Bent, gently combing back the child's soft brown hair,
before she passed the sponge of warm water over her face.</p>
<p>&quot;But why did he not take his things with him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, ma'am, he--he left unexpectedly; and so they remained here.&quot;</p>
<p>Now, in making this somewhat evasive answer, Mrs. Bent had no particular wish
to deceive. But, what with the work she had before her, and what with the
fretful child on her knee, it was not exactly the moment for entering on gossip.
The disappearance of Anthony Castlemaine was too public and popular a theme in
the neighbourhood for any idea of concealment to be connected with it. The lady,
however, thought she meant to evade the subject, and said no more. Indeed the
child claimed all their attention.</p>
<p>&quot;Marie soif,&quot; said the little one, as they put her into bed. &quot;Maman, Marie
soif.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thirsty, always thirsty!&quot; repeated the mother in English. &quot;I don't much like
it; it bespeaks fever.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll get some milk and water,&quot; said Mrs. Bent.</p>
<p>&quot;No, no, not milk,&quot; interposed the lady. &quot;Oui, ma chrie! A spoonful or two
of sugar and water while maman makes the tisane. Madame has herbs, no doubt,&quot;
she added, turning to the landlady. &quot;I could make it soon myself at this good
fire if I had a little casserole: a--what you call it?--saucepan.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Bent promised the herbs, for she had a store-room fall of different
kinds, and the saucepan. A little sugared water was given to the child, who lay
quiet after drinking it, and closed her eyes. Moving noiselessly about the room,
the lady happened to go near the window, and her eye caught the moving sea in
the distance, on which some bright light yet lingered. Opening the casement
window for a moment, she put her head out, and gazed around.</p>
<p>&quot;The sea is very nice to see, but I don't like to think of being on it,&quot; she
said as she shut the window. &quot;What is that great building over yonder to the
left?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's the Grey Nunnery, ma'am.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Grey Nunnery! What, have you a nunnery here in this little place? I had
no idea.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's not a real nunnery,&quot; said Mrs. Bent, as she proceeded to explain what
it was, in the intervals of folding the child's clothes, and how good the ladies
were who inhabited it. &quot;We heard a bit of news about it this afternoon,&quot; she
added, her propensity for talking creeping out. &quot;Sister Ann ran over here to
borrow a baking-dish--for their own came in two in the oven with all the baked
apples in it--and she said she believed Miss Castlemaine was going to join them
as the Lady Superior.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Miss--who?&quot; cried the stranger quickly.</p>
<p>&quot;Miss Castlemaine. Perhaps, ma'am, you may have heard of the Castlemaines of
Greylands' Rest. It is close by.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I do not know them,&quot; said the traveller. &quot;Is, then, a Miss Castlemaine, of
Greylands' Rest, the Lady Superior of the Nunnery?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Miss Castlemaine of Stilborough, ma'am. There is no Miss Castlemaine of
Greylands' Rest; save a tiresome little chit of twelve. She has not joined them
yet; it is only in contemplation. Sister Ann was all cock-a-hoop about it: but I
told her the young lady was too beautiful to hide her head under a muslin cap in
a nunnery.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is a grand old building,&quot; said the traveller, &quot;and must stand out well
and nobly on the edge of the cliff. And what a length! I cannot see the other
end.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The other end is nearly in ruins--part of it, at least. The chapel quite so.
That lies between the Nunnery and the Friar's Keep.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Friar's Keep!&quot; repeated the lady. &quot;You have odd names here. But I like
this village. It is quiet: nobody seems to pass.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There's hardly anybody in it to pass, for that matter,&quot; cried Mrs. Bent,
with disparagement. &quot;Just the fishermen and the Grey Sisters. But here I am,
talking when I ought to be doing! What would you like to have prepared for
dinner, ma'am?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I could not eat--I feel feverish, too,&quot; was the answer given, in an accent
that had a ring of piteous wail. &quot;I will take but some tea and a tartine when I
have made the tisane.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Bent opened her eyes. &quot;Tea and a tart, did you say, ma'am?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I said--I mean bread and butter,&quot; explained the stranger, translating her
French word.</p>
<p>&quot;And--what name--if I may ask, ma'am?&quot; continued Mrs. Bent, as a final
question.</p>
<p>&quot;I am Madame Guise.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tea's best, after all, upon a day's travelling,&quot; were the landlady's final
words as she descended the stairs. There she told her husband that the lady had
rather a curious name, sounding like Madame Geese.</p>
<p>The small saucepan and the herbs were taken up immediately by Molly, who said
she was to stay and help make the stuff, if the lady required her. The lady
seemed to be glad of her help, and showed her how to pick the dried leaves from
the thicker stalks.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you have travellers staying here often?&quot; asked Madame Guise, standing by
Molly after she had asked her name, and doing her own portion of the work.</p>
<p>&quot;A'most never in winter time,&quot; replied Molly--a round-eyed, red-cheeked,
strong-looking damsel, attired in a blue linsey skirt and a cotton handkerchief
crossed on her neck. &quot;We had a gentleman for a week or two just at the turn o'
January. He had this here same bedroom.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They were his things, doubtless, that your mistress said she was removing to
make space for me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In course they were,&quot; replied Molly. &quot;Master said he'd not have this room
used--that the coats and things should stay in it: but missis likes to take her
own way. This here stalk, mum--is he too big to go in?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That is: we must have only the little ones. What was the gentleman's name,
Mollee?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He was young Mr. Castlemaine: a foreign gentleman, so to say: nephew to the
one at Greylands' Rest. He came over here to put in his claim to the money and
lands.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And where did he go?--where is he now?&quot; questioned Madame Guise, with an
eagerness that might have betrayed her painful interest, had the servant's
suspicions been on the alert.</p>
<p>&quot;It's what my master would just give his head to know,&quot; was the answer. &quot;He
went into the Friar's Keep one moon light night, and never came out on't again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Never came out of it again!&quot; echoed Madame Guise &quot;What do you mean?--How was
that?&quot;</p>
<p>Bit by bit Molly revealed the whole story, together with sundry items of the
superstition attaching to the Friar's Keep. Very much gratified was she at the
opportunity of doing it. The tale was encompassed by so many marvels, both of
reality and imagination, by so much mystery, by so wide a field of wonder
altogether, that others in Greylands, as well as Molly, thought it a red-letter
day when they could find strange ears to impart it to.</p>
<p>Madame Guise sat down in a chair, her hands clasped before her, and
forgetting the herbs. Molly saw how pale she looked; and felt prouder than any
peacock at her own powers of narration.</p>
<p>&quot;But what became of him, Mollee?&quot; questioned the poor lady.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, mum, that lies in doubt, you see. Some say he was spirited away by the
Grey Monk.&quot;</p>
<p>Madame Guise shook her head. &quot;That could not be,&quot; she said slowly, and
somewhat in hesitation. &quot;I don't like revenants myself--but that could not be.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And others think,&quot; added Molly, dropping her voice, &quot;that he was done away
with by his uncle, Mr. Castlemaine. Master do, for one.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Done away with! How?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Murdered,&quot; said the girl, plunging the herbs into the saucepan of water.</p>
<p>A shudder took Madame Guise from head to foot. Molly looked round at her: she
was like one seized with ague.</p>
<p>&quot;I am cold and fatigued with my long journey,&quot; she murmured, seeking to
afford some plausible excuse to the round-eyed girl. &quot;And it always startles one
to hear talk of murder.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So it do, mum,&quot; acquiesced Molly. &quot;I dun'no which is worst to hear tell on;
that or ghosts.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But--this Friar's Keep that you talk of, Mollee--it may be that he fell from
it by accident into the sea.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Couldn't,&quot; shortly corrected Molly. &quot;There ain't no way to fall--no opening.
They be biling up beautiful, mum.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And--was he never--never seen again since that night?&quot; pursued Madame Guise,
casting mechanically a glance on the steaming saucepan.</p>
<p>&quot;Never seen nor heard on,&quot; protested Molly emphatically. &quot;His clothes and his
portmanteau and all his other things have stayed on here; but he has never come
back to claim 'em.&quot;</p>
<p>Madame Guise put her hands on her pallid face, as if to hide the terror
there. Molly, her work done, and about to depart, was sweeping the bits of
stalks and herbs from the table into her clean check apron.</p>
<p>&quot;Does the voisinage know all this?&quot; asked Madame Guise, looking up. &quot;Is it
talked of openly? May I speak of it to monsieur and madame en bas--to the host
and hostess, I would say?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why bless you, mum, yes! There have been nothing else talked of in the place
since. Nobody hardly comes in here but what begins upon it.&quot;</p>
<p>Molly left with the last words. Madame Guise sat on, she knew not how long,
her face buried in her hands, and the tisane was boiled too much. The little
girl, soothed perhaps by the murmur of voices, had fallen fast asleep. By-and-by
Mrs. Bent came up, to know when her guest would be ready for tea.</p>
<p>&quot;I am ready now,&quot; was the lady's answer, after attending to the tisane. &quot;And
I wish that you and your husband, madame, would allow me to take the meal with
you this one evening,&quot; added Madame Guise, with a slight shiver, as they
descended the dark staircase. &quot;I feel lonely and fatigued, and in want of
companionship.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Bent was gratified, rather than otherwise at the request. They
descended; and she caused the tea-tray, already laid in their room, to be
carried into the parlour. The same parlour, as the room above was the same
bedroom, that had been occupied by the ill-fated Anthony Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope you are a little less tired than you were when you arrived, madam,&quot;
said John Bent, bowing, as he with deprecation took his seat at last, and
stirred his tea.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, I have been forgetting my fatigue in listening to the story of
one Mr. Anthony Castlemaine's disappearance,&quot; replied Madams Guise, striving to
speak with indifference. &quot;The account is curious, and has interested me. Mollee
thought you would give me the particulars.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, he'll do that, madam,&quot; put in Mrs. Bent sharply. &quot;There's nothing he
likes better than talking of <i>that</i>. Tell it, John.&quot;</p>
<p>John did as he was bid. But his account was in substance the same as Molly's.
He could tell neither more nor less: some few additional small details perhaps,
some trifling particulars; but of real information he could give none. The poor
lady, hungering after a word of enlightenment that might tend to lessen her
dread and horror, listened for it in vain.</p>
<p>&quot;But what explanation can be given of it?&quot; she urged, biting her dry lips to
hide their trembling. &quot;People cannot disappear without cause. Are you sure it
was Mr. Castlemaine you saw go in at the gate, and thence into the Friar's
Keep?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am as sure of it, ma'am, as I am that this is a tea-cup before me. Mr.
Castlemaine denies it, though.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you suspect--you suspect that he murdered him! That is a frightful word;
I cannot bear to say it. Meurte!&quot; she repeated in her own tongue, with a passing
shiver. &quot;Quelle chose affreuse! You suspect Mr. Castlemaine, sir, I say?&quot;</p>
<p>John Bent shook his head. The encounter with Ethel had taught him caution. &quot;I
don't know, ma'am,&quot; he answered; &quot;I can't say. That the young man was killed in
some way, I have no doubt of--and I think Mr. Castlemaine must know something
about it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are there any places in this--what you call it?--Friar's Keep?--that he
could be concealed in? Any dungeons?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He's not there, ma'am. The place is open enough for anybody to go in that
likes. Mr. Castlemaine had a man over from Stilborough to help him search, and
they went all about it together. I and Superintendent Nettleby also went over it
one day, and some others with us. There wasn't a trace to be seen of young Mr.
Anthony; nothing to show that he had been there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So it resolves itself into this much,&quot; said Madame Guise--&quot;that you saw this
Mr. Anthony Castlemaine go into the dark place, on that February night; and, so
far as can be ascertained, he never came out again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just that,&quot; said John Bent. &quot;I'd give this right hand of mine&quot;--lifting
it--&quot;to know what his fate has been. Something tells me that it will be brought
to light.&quot;</p>
<p>Madame Guise went up to her room, and sat down there with her heavy burthen
of terror and sorrow, wondering what would be the next scene in this strange
mystery, and what she herself could best do towards unravelling it. Mrs. Bent,
coming in by-and-by, found her weeping hysterically. Marie woke up at the
moment, and they gave her some of the tisane.</p>
<p>&quot;It is the reaction of the cold and long journey, ma'am,&quot; pronounced Mrs.
Bent, in regard to the tears she had seen. &quot;And perhaps the talking about this
unaccountable business has startled you. You will be better after a night's
rest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, the coach was very cold. I will say goodnight to you and go to bed.&quot;</p>
<p>As Mrs. Bent retired, the lady sank on her knees by the side of her child,
and buried her face in the white counterpane. There she prayed; prayed
earnestly; for help from Above, for strength to bear.</p>
<p>&quot;The good God grant that the enlightenment may be less terrible than are
these my fears,&quot; she implored, with lifted hands and streaming eyes.</p>
<p>Back came Mrs. Bent, a wine-glass in one hand, and a hot-water bottle for the
bed in the other. The glass contained some of her famous cordial--in her opinion
a remedy for half the ills under the sun. Madame Guise was then quietly seated
by the fire, gazing into it with a far-away look, her hands folded on her lap.
She drank the glass of cordial with thanks: though it seemed of no moment what
she drank or what she did not drink just then. And little Marie, her cheeks
flushed, her rosy lips open sufficiently to show her pretty white teeth, had
dropped off to sleep again.</p>

<h4><a name="div1_13" href="#div1Ref_13">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h4>
<h5>A STORM OF WIND.</h5>
<br>

<p>The wind was rising. Coming in gusts from across the sea, it swept round the
Dolphin Inn with a force that seemed to shake the old walls and stir the
windowpanes--for the corner that made the site of the inn was always an exposed
one. Madame Guise, undressing slowly by the expiring fire in her chamber,
shivered as she listened to it.</p>
<p>The wind did not howl in this fashion around her own sheltered home in the
sunny Dauphine. There was no grand sea there for it to whirl and play over, and
come off with a shrieking moan. Not often there did they get cold weather like
this; or white snow covering the plains; or ice in the water-jugs. And never yet
before in her uneventful life, had it fallen to her lot to travel all across
France from South to North with a little child to take care of, and then to
encounter the many hours' passage in a stifling ship on a rough and raging sea:
and after a night's rest in London to come off again in the cold English
stage-coach for how many miles she hew not. All this might have served to take
the colour from her face and to give the shiverings to her frame--for land
travelling in those days was not the easy pastime it is made now.</p>
<p>But there was worse behind it. Not the cold, not the want of rest, was it
that was so trying to her, but the frightful whispers of a supposed tragedy that
had (so to say) greeted her arrival at the Dolphin. But a few hours yet within
its walls, and she had been told that him of whom she had come in secret search,
her husband, had disappeared out of life.</p>
<p>For this poor young lady, Charlotte Guise, was in truth the wife of Anthony
Castlemaine. His wife if he were still living; his widow if he were dead. That
he was dead, hearing all she had heard, no doubt could exist in her mind; no
hope of the contrary, not the faintest shadow of it, could enter her heart. She
had come all this long journey in search of her husband, fearing some vague
treachery; she had arrived to find that treachery of the deepest dye had only
too probably put him out of sight for ever.</p>
<p>When the father, Basil Castlemaine, was on his death-bed, she had heard the
charge he gave to Anthony, to come over to England and put in the claim to his
right inheritance; she had heard the warning of possible treachery that had
accompanied it.</p>
<p>Basil died. And when Anthony, in obedience to his father's last injunctions,
was making ready for the journey to England, his wife recalled the warning to
him. He laughed at her. He answered jokingly saying that if he never returned to
Gap, she might come off to see the reason, and whether he was still in the land
of the living. Ah, how many a word spoken in jest would, if we might read the
future, bear a solemn meaning! That was one.</p>
<p>Anthony Castlemaine departed on his mission to England, leaving his wife and
little child in their home at Gap. The first letter Charlotte received from her
husband told her of his arrival at Greylands, and that he had put up at the
Dolphin Inn. It intimated that he might not find his course a very smooth one,
and that his uncle James was in possession of Greylands' Rest. Some days further
on she received a second letter from him; and following closely upon it, by the
next post in fact, a third. Both these letters bore the same date. The first of
them stated that he was not advancing at all; that all kinds of impediments were
being placed in his way by his uncles; they appeared resolved to keep him out of
the estate, refusing even to show him how it was left and it ended with an
expressed conviction that his Uncle James was usurping it. The last letter told
her that since posting the other letter earlier in the day, he had seen his
Uncle James; that the interview, which had taken place in a meadow, was an
unpleasant one, his uncle even having tried to strike him that he (Anthony)
really did not know what to be at, but had resolved to try for one more
conference with his uncle before proceeding to take legal measures, and that he
should certainly write to her again in the course of a day or two to tell her
whether matters progressed or whether they did not. In this last letter there
ran a vein of sadness, very perceptible to the wife. She thought her husband
must have been in very bad spirits when he wrote it: and she anxiously looked
for the further news promised.</p>
<p>It never came. No subsequent letter ever reached her. After waiting some
days, she wrote to her husband at the Dolphin Inn, but she got no answer. She
wrote again, and with the like result. Then, feeling strangely uneasy, not
knowing how to get tidings of him, or to whom to apply, she began to think that
she would have to put in practice the suggestion he had but spoken in jest, and
go over to England to look after him. A short period of vacillation--for it
looked like a frightfully formidable step to the untravelled young lady--and she
resolved upon it. Arranging the affairs of her petit menage, as she expressed
it, she started off with her child; and in due time reached London. There she
stayed one night, after sending off a note to Greylands, directed to her husband
at the Dolphin Inn, to tell of her intended arrival on the following day; and in
the morning she took her seat in the Stilborough coach. These three letters, the
two from Gap and the one from London, were those that led to the dispute between
Mr. and Mrs. Bent, which Ethel Reene had disturbed. The landlord had them safely
locked up in his private archives.</p>
<p>Forewarned, forearmed, is an old saying. Anthony Castlemaine's wife had been
warned, and she strove to be armed. She would not present herself openly and in
her own name at Greylands. If the Castlemaine family were dealing hardly with
her husband, it would be more prudent for her to go to work warily and appear
there at first as a stranger. The worst she had feared was, that Mr. James
Castlemaine might be holding her husband somewhere at bay; perhaps even had put
him in a prison--she did not understand the English laws--and she must seek him
out and release him. So she called herself Guise as soon as she landed in
England. Her name had been Guise before her marriage, and she assumed it now.
Not much of an assumption: in accordance with the French customs of her native
place, she retained her maiden name as an affix to her husband's, and her cards
were printed Madame Castlemaine-Guise. Had her assertion of the name wanted
confirmation, there it was on the small trunk; which had GUISE studded on it in
brass nails, for it had belonged to her father. Her intention had been to
proceed to Stilborough, put up there, and come over to Greylands the following
day. But when she found the coach passed through Greylands--which she had not
known, and she first recognised the place by the sign of the famous dolphin,
about which Anthony had written to her in his first letter--she resolved to
alight there, the little girl's symptoms of feverish illness affording a pretext
for it. And so, here she was, at the often-heard-of Dolphin Inn, inhabiting the
very chamber that her ill-fated husband had occupied, and with the dread story
she had listened to beating its terrors in her brain.</p>
<p>A gust of wind shook the white dimity curtain, drawn before the casement, and
she turned to it with a shiver. What did this angry storm of wind mean? Why
should it have arisen suddenly without apparent warning? Charlotte Guise was
rather superstitious, and asked herself the question. When she got out of the
coach at the inn door, the air and sea were calm. Could the angry disturbance
have come to show her that the very elements were rising at the wrong dealt out
to her husband? Some such an idea took hold of her.</p>
<p>&quot;Every second minute I ask whether it can be true,&quot; she murmured in her
native language; &quot;or whether I have but dropped asleep in my own house, and am
dreaming it all. It is not like reality. It is not like any story I ever heard
before. Anthony comes over here, all those hundreds of weary miles, over that
miserable sea, and finds himself amid his family; his family whom he had never
seen. 'Greylands' Rest is mine, I think,' he says to them; 'will you give it to
me?' And they deny that it is his. 'Then,' says he, 'what you say may be so; but
you should just show me the deeds--the proofs that it is not mine.' And they
decline to show them; and his uncle, James Castlemaine, at an interview in the
field, seeks to strike him. Anthony comes home to the hotel here, and writes
that last letter to me, and puts it in the post late at night. Then he and the
landlord go walking out together in the moonlight, and by-and-by they see Mr.
James Castlemaine go into a lonely place of cloisters called the Friar's Keep,
and he, nay poor husband, runs in after him; and he never comes out of it again.
The host, waiting for him outside, hears a shot and an awful cry, but he does
not connect it with the cloisters; and so he promenades about till he's weary,
thinking the uncle and nephew are talking together, and--and Anthony never at
all comes out again! Yes, it is very plain: it is too plain to me: that shot
took my dear husband's life. James Castlemaine, fearing he would make good his
claim to the estate and turn him out of it, has murdered him.&quot;</p>
<p>The wind shrieked, as if it were singing a solemn requiem; the small panes of
the casement seemed to crack, and the white curtain fluttered. Charlotte Guise
hid her shrinking face for a moment, and then turned it on the shaking curtain,
her white lips parting with some scarcely breathed words.</p>
<p>&quot;If the spirits of the dead are permitted to hover in the air, as some people
believe perhaps his spirit is here now, at this very window! Seeking to hold
commune with mine; calling upon me to avenge him. Oh, Anthony, yes! I will never
rest until I have found out the mystery of your fate. I will devote my days to
doing it!&quot;</p>
<p>As if to encourage the singular fancy, that the whispered story and the
surroundings of the hour had called up in her over-strung nerves and brain, a
gust wilder than any that had gone before swept past the house at the moment
with a rushing moan. The casement shook; its fastenings seemed to strain: and
the poor young lady, in some irrepressible freak of courage, born of
desperation, drew aside the curtain and looked forth.</p>
<p>No, no; nothing was there but the wind. The white snow lay on the ground, and
covered the cliff that skirted the beach on the right. The night was light,
disclosing the foam of the waves as they rose and fell; clouds were sweeping
madly across the face of the sky.</p>
<p>The little girl stirred in bed and threw out her arms. Her mother let fall
the window curtain and softly approached her. The hot face wore its
fever-crimson; the large brown eyes, so like her father's, opened the red lips
parted with a cry.</p>
<p>&quot;Maman! Marie soif; Marie veut boire.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, is she fatherless?&quot; mentally cried the poor mother, as she took up the
glass of tisane. &quot;Oui, ma petite! ma chrie! Bois donc, Marie; bois!&quot;</p>
<p>The child seized the glass with her hot and trembling little hands, and drank
from it. She seemed very thirsty. Before her mother had replaced it within the
fender and come back to her, her pretty face was on the pillow again, her eyes
were closing.</p>
<p>Madame Guise--as we must continue to call her--went to bed: but not to sleep.
The wind raged, the child by her side was restless, her own mind was in a chaos
of horror and trouble. The words of the prophet Isaiah in Holy Writ might indeed
have been applied to her: The whole head was sick and the whole heart faint.</p>
<p>Towards morning she dropped into a disturbed sleep, during which a dream
visited her. And the dream was certainly a singular one. She thought she was
alone in a strange, dark garden: gloomy trees clustered about her, ugly looking
mountains rose above. She seemed to be searching for something; to be obliged to
search, but she did not know for what; a great dread, or terror, lay upon her,
and but for being impelled she would not have dared to put one foot before the
other in the dark path. Suddenly, as she was pushing through the impeding trees,
her husband stood before her. She put out her hand to greet him; but he did not
respond to it, but remained where he had halted, a few paces off, gazing at her
fixedly. It was not the husband who had parted from her in the sunny South; a
happy man full of glad anticipations, with a bright fresh face and joyous words
on his lips: but her husband with a sad, stern countenance, pale, cold, and
still. Her heart seemed to sink within her, and before she could ask him what
was amiss she saw that he was holding his waistcoat aside with his left hand, to
display a shot in the region of the heart. A most dreadful sensation of terror,
far more dreadful than any she could ever know in this life, seized upon her at
the sight; she screamed aloud and awoke. Awoke with the drops of moisture on her
face, and trembling in every limb.</p>
<p>Now, as will be clear to every practical mind, this dream, remarkable though
it was, must have been only the result of her own imaginative thoughts, of the
tale she had heard, of the fears and doubts she had been indulging before going
to sleep. But she, poor distressed, lonely lady, looked upon it as a revelation.
From that moment she never doubted that her husband had been shot as described;
shot in the heart and killed: and that the hand that did it was Mr.
Castlemaine's.</p>
<p>&quot;I knew his spirit might be hovering about me,&quot; she murmured, trying to still
her trembling, as she sat up in bed. &quot;He has been permitted to appear to me to
show me the truth--to enjoin on me the task of bringing the deed to light. By
Heaven's help I will do it! I will never quit this spot, this Greylands, until I
have accomplished it. Yes, Anthony!--can you hear me, my husband?--I vow to
devote myself to the discovery; I will bring this dark wickedness into the broad
glare of noonday. Country, kindred, home, friends!--I will forget them all,
Anthony, in my search for you.</p>
<p>&quot;Where have they hidden him?&quot; she resumed after a little pause. &quot;Had Mr.
Castlemaine an accomplice?--or did he act alone. Oh, alone; of a certainty,
alone,&quot; she continued, answering her own question. &quot;He would not have dared it
had others been present; and the landlord below says Mr. Castlemaine was by
himself when he went into the cloisters. Did he fling him into the sea after he
was dead?--or did he conceal him somewhere in that place--that Keep? Perhaps he
buried him in it? if so, his body is lying in unconsecrated ground, and it will
never rest.--Marie, then, my little one, what is it? Are you better this
morning?&quot;</p>
<p>The child was awaking with a moan. She had been baptised and registered in
her native place as Mary Ursula. Her grandfather, Basil, never called her
anything else; her father would sometimes shorten it to &quot;Marie Ursule:&quot; but her
mother, not so well accustomed to the English tongue as they were, generally
used but the one name, Marie. She looked up and put out her little hands to her
mother: her eyes were heavy, her cheeks flushed and feverish.</p>
<p>That the child was worse than she had been the previous night, there could be
little question of, and Madame Guise felt some alarm. When breakfast was
over--of which meal the child refused to partake, but still complained of
thirst--she inquired whether there was a doctor in the place. She asked for him
as she would have asked in her own land. Is there a medecin here? and Mrs. Bent
interpreted it as medicine, comprehended that medicine was requested, and
rejoiced accordingly. Mrs. Bent privately put down the non-improvement to the
tisane. Had a good wholesome powder been administered over night, the child, she
believed, would have been all right this morning.</p>
<p>The doctor, Mr. Parker, came in answer to the summons: a grey-haired,
pleasant-speaking man. He had formerly been in large practice at Stilborough;
but after a dangerous illness which attacked him there and lasted more than a
year, he took the advice of his friends and retired from the fatigues of his
profession. His means were sufficient to live without it. Removing to Greylands,
for change of air, and for the benefit of the salt sea-breezes, he grew to like
the quietude of the place, and determined to make it his home for good. Learning
that a small, pretty villa was for sale, he purchased it. It lay back from the
coach road beyond the Dolphin Inn, nearly opposite the avenue that led to
Greylands' Rest. The house belonged to Mr. Blackett of the Grange--the Grange
being the chief residence at a small hamlet about two miles off; and Mr.
Castlemaine had always intended to purchase it should it be in the market, but
Mr. Blackett had hitherto refused to sell. His deciding to do so at length was
quite a sudden whim; Mr. Parker heard of it, and secured the little
property--which was anything but agreeable at the time to the Master of
Greylands.</p>
<p>There Mr. Parker had since resided, and had become strong and healthy again.
He had so far resumed his calling as to attend when a doctor was wanted in
Greylands, for there was none nearer than Stilborough. At first Mr. Parker took
to respond for humanity's sake when appealed to, and he continued it from love
of his profession. Not for one visit in ten did he get paid, nor did he want to:
the fishermen were poor, and he was large-hearted.</p>
<p>After examining the little lady traveller, he pronounced her to be suffering
from a slight attack of inflammation of the chest, induced, no doubt, by the
cold to which she had been exposed when travelling. Madame Guise informed him
that they had journeyed from Paris (it was no untruth, for they had passed
through the French capital and stayed a night in it), and the weather had become
very sharp as they neared the coast--which coast it had taken them two days and
a night in the diligence to reach; and the sea voyage had been fearfully hard,
and had tried the little one. Yes, yes, the doctor answered, the inclement cold
had attacked the little J girl, and she must stay in bed and be taken care of.
Madame Guise took occasion to observe that she had been going farther on, but,
on perceiving her child's symptoms of illness, had halted at this small village,
called Greylands, which looked open and healthy--but the wind had got up at
night. Got up very much and very suddenly, assented the doctor, got up to a
gale, and it was all the better for the little one that she had not gone on. He
thought he might have to put a small blister on in the afternoon, but he should
see. A blister?--what was that? returned madame, not familiar with the English
word. Oh, she remembered, she added a moment after--a vsicatoire.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, yes, I see it all: Heaven is helping me,&quot; mentally spoke poor Charlotte
Guise, as she took up her post by Marie after the doctor's departure, and
revolved matters in her mind. &quot;This illness has been sent on purpose: a token to
me that I have done right to come to Greylands, and that I am to stay in it. And
by the good help of Heaven I will stay, until I shall have tracked home the fate
of my husband to Mr. Castlemaine.&quot;</p>

<h4><a name="div1_14" href="#div1Ref_14">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h4>
<h5>PLOTTING AND PLANNING.</h5>
<br>

<p>The illness of little Marie Guise lasted several days. Sitting by her bed--as
she did for hours together--Madame Guise had time, and to spare, to lay out her
plans. That is, as far as she could lay them out. Her sole object in life
now--save and except the child--was to search out the mystery of her husband's
fate; her one hope to bring home the crime to Mr. Castlemaine. How to set about
it she knew not. She would have to account in some plausible manner for her
prolonged stay at Greylands, and to conceal her real identity. Above all, she
must take care never to betray interest in the fate of Anthony Castlemaine.</p>
<p>To stay in Greylands, or in England at all, might be rather difficult, unless
she could get some employment to eke out her means. She knew perfectly well that
without her husband's signature, the cautious French bankers and men of business
who held his property in their hands, would not advance much, if any, of it to
her, unless proofs were forthcoming of his death. She possessed a little income
of her own: it was available, and she must concert ways and means of its being
transmitted to her in secret, without Greylands learning who she was, and what
she was. This might be done: but the money would not be enough to support her
and her child comfortably as gentlewomen.</p>
<p>&quot;I think I should like to make a sojourn here in Greylands,&quot; she observed to
M. Bent, cautiously opening the subject, on the first day that Marie could be
pronounced convalescent, and was taken down in the parlour for a change.</p>
<p>&quot;Why! should you, ma'am!&quot; returned the landlady briskly. &quot;Well, it's a nice
place.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I like the sea--and I should wish my little one to remain quiet now. I have
suffered too much anxiety on her account to take her travelling again just yet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sweet little thing!&quot; aspirated Mrs. Bent. &quot;Her pretty rosy colour is
beginning to come back to her cheeks again. I've never seen a child with a
brighter.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is like her--like that of some of our relatives: they have a bright
colour,&quot; said Madame Guise, who only just saved herself from saying--like her
father's. &quot;For her sake I will remain here for some two or three months. Do you
think I could get an apartment?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An apartment!&quot; repeated Mrs. Bent, who took the word literally, and was
somewhat puzzled at it. &quot;Did you mean one single room, ma'am.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I mean two or three rooms--as might be enough. Or a small house--what you
call a cottage.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I see, ma'am,&quot; said the landlady. &quot;I think you might do that. Some of
the larger cottages let rooms in the summer to people coming over here from
Stilborough for the sea air. And there's one pretty furnished cottage empty on
the cliff.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Would the rent of it be much?&quot; asked Madame Guise, timorously, for a whole
furnished cottage seemed a large enterprise.</p>
<p>&quot;Next to nothing at this season,&quot; spoke Mrs. Bent, confidentially. &quot;Here,
John Bent--where are you?&quot; she cried, flinging open the door. &quot;What's the rent
of that place----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Master's out,&quot; interrupted Molly, coming from the back kitchen to speak.</p>
<p>&quot;Just like him!&quot; retorted Mrs. Bent. &quot;He is out when he's wanted, and at home
when he's not. It's always the way with the men. Any way it's a nice little
place, ma'am, and I know it would be reasonable.&quot;</p>
<p>The cottage she alluded to had a sitting-room, a kitchen, and two
bedchambers, and was situated in the most picturesque part of all the cliff,
close to the neatly kept cottage that had so long been inhabited by Miss Hallet
and her very pretty niece. It was plainly furnished, and might be let at this
season, including steel knives and forks, for fifteen shillings a week, Mrs.
Bent thought. In summer the rent would be twenty-five: and the tenant had to
find linen.</p>
<p>Madame Guise made a silent computation. Fifteen shillings a week! With the
rent, and the cost of a servant, and housekeeping, and various little extras
that are somehow never computed beforehand, but that rise up inevitably
afterwards, she saw that the sum total would be more than she could command. And
she hesitated to take the cottage.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, she went with Mrs. Bent to see it, and found it just what she
would have liked. It was not quite so nice as Miss Hallet's a few yards off: but
Miss Hallet took so much care that hers should be perfection.</p>
<p>&quot;If I could but earn a little money!&quot; repeated Charlotte to herself. &quot;I
wonder whether those good ladies at the Grey Nunnery could help me! I have a
great mind to ask them.&quot;</p>
<p>After some deliberation, she went over to do so. It was a warm, pleasant day;
for the capricious weather had once more changed; the snow and frost given place
to soft west winds and genial sunshine--and Madame Guise was shown into the
reception parlour. Sisters Margaret and Grizzel sat in it, and rose at her
entrance. They had heard of this lady traveller, who had been detained on her
journey by the illness of her little girl, and was staying at the Dolphin; but
they had not seen her. It was with some curiosity, therefore, that the ladies
gazed to see what she was like. A slender, ladylike, nice-looking, young woman,
with blue eyes and fair hair, and who seemed to carry some care on her
countenance.</p>
<p>Madame Guise introduced herself; apologising for her intrusion, and telling
them at once its object. She wished to make some stay at Greylands, for she
thought the pure air and sea-breezes would strengthen her child--could the
ladies help her to some employment by which she might earn a trifle. She had a
little income, but not quite sufficient. She could teach music and French, or do
fine needlework; embroidery and the like.</p>
<p>The ladies answered her very kindly--they were both taken with the gentle
stranger--but shook their heads to her petition: they had no help to give.</p>
<p>&quot;The children we bring up here are of poor parentage and do not need
accomplishments,&quot; said Sister Margaret. &quot;If they did, we should teach them in
the Nunnery: indeed we should be thankful to get pupils of a better class
ourselves, for we are but poor. Sister Mona is a good French scholar; and Sister
Charlotte's music is perfect. As to fine work, we do not know anyone who
requires it to be done.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not but that we should have been glad to help you, if we could,&quot; put in
Sister Grizzel, with a pleasant smile.</p>
<p>Madame Guise rose, stifling a sigh. She saw exactly how it was--that the Grey
Nunnery was about the last place able to assist her. In leaving the parlour, she
met a lady, young and stately, who was entering it; one of wondrous beauty,
tall, majestic, of gracious manner and presence.</p>
<p>&quot;Our Superior, Sister Mary Ursula,&quot; said Sister Grizzel.</p>
<p>And Madame Guise knew that it was her husband's cousin--for Miss Castlemaine
had joined the Sisterhood some days past. She wore the clear muslin cap over her
luxuriant hair, but not the Grey habit, for she had not put aside the mourning
for her father. In the magnificent dark eyes, in the bright complexion and in
the beautiful features, Madame Guise saw the likeness to her husband and to the
rest of the Castlemaines. Sister Mary Ursula bowed and said a few gracious
words: Madame Guise responded with one of her elaborate French curtseys, and
passed onwards through the gate.</p>
<p>&quot;So that hope has failed!&quot; she thought, as she crossed over to the inn. &quot;I
might have known it would: with so many accomplished ladies among themselves,
the Sisters cannot want other people's aid.&quot;</p>
<p>Buried in thought, perplexed as to what her future course should be, Madame
Guise did not go at once indoors, but sat down on the bench outside the house.
The window of the sitting-room, occupied by John Bent and his wife, stood
open--for Mrs. Bent liked plenty of fresh air--and people were talking inside.
On that same bench had sat more than once her unfortunate husband, looking at
the water as she was looking, at the fishermen collected on the beach, at the
boats out at sea, their white sails at rest in the calm of the sunshiny day. She
was mentally questioning what else she could try, now that her mission to the
Grey Sisters had failed, and wondering how little she and Marie could live upon,
if she got nothing to do. Gradually the talking became clearer to her ear. She
heard the landlady's voice and another voice: not John Bent's, but the young,
free, ready voice of a gentleman. It was in truth Harry Castlemaine's; who,
passing the inn, had turned in for a gossip.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems to me like a great sacrifice, Mr. Harry,&quot; were the first distinct
words that fell on Madame Guise's ear. &quot;The Grey Ladies are very good and noble;
next door to angels, I'm sure, when folks are sick; but it is not the right life
for Miss Castlemaine to take to.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We told her so until we were tired of telling it,&quot; returned Harry
Castlemaine. &quot;It has cut up my father grievously. We will drop the subject, Mrs.
Bent: I cannot speak of it with patience yet. How is the sick child getting on?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As well as can be, sir. She is just now upstairs in her midday sleep.
Talking of children, though,&quot; broke off Mrs. Bent, &quot;what is this mishap that has
happened to Miss Flora? We hear she met with some accident yesterday.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mounted to the top of the gardener's ladder and fell off it,&quot; said Harry,
with equanimity. &quot;She is always in mischief.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And was she hurt, sir?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not much. Grazed her face in a few places and put her wrist out. She will
come to greater grief unless they get somebody to take care of her. Having been
so long without a governess, the young damsel is like a wild colt.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The last time Mrs. Castlemaine passed by here on foot, Mr. Harry, she told
me she had just engaged a governess. It must be a fortnight ago.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And so she had engaged one; but the lady was taken ill and threw up the
situation. Mrs. Castlemaine is hard to please in the matter of governesses. She
must have perfect French and perfect music: and the two, united with other
requisite qualifications, seem difficult to find. Mrs. Castlemaine was talking
this morning of advertising.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dear me! to think that such a fine post as that should be going a begging!&quot;
cried the landlady. &quot;A gentleman's home and a plenty of comfort in it, and--and
however much pay is it a year, Mr. Harry?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fifty guineas, I think,&quot; said the young man carelessly, as though
fifty-guinea salaries were an every day trifle. Mrs. Bent lifted her hands and
eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Fifty guineas!--and her bed and board. And only one little lady to teach;
and gentlefolks to live with! My goodness! Mr. Harry, one would think half the
ladies in England would jump at it.&quot;</p>
<p><i>One</i> lady at least was ready to &quot;jump&quot; at it: she who sat outside,
overhearing the tale. The lips of Charlotte Guise parted as she listened; her
cheeks flushed red with excitement. Oh, if she herself could obtain this
place!--become an inmate of the house where dwelt her husband's enemy, James
Castlemaine! How seemingly clear and straightforward would be her path of
discovery then, compared with what it would be in that cottage on the cliff, or
with any other position she could hope to be placed in! She could daily, hourly
watch Mr. Castlemaine; and it must surely be her fault if she did not track home
the deed to him! As to her fitness for the post, why French was her native
language, and in music she was a finished artiste: and she could certainly
undertake general instruction!</p>
<p>While the red flush was yet on her face, the light of excitement in her eyes,
Harry Castlemaine came out. Seeing her sitting there, he guessed who she was,
took off his hat and politely accosted her, saying he was glad to hear the
little girl was improving. Madame Guise rose. It was the first time she had
spoken to him.</p>
<p>&quot;I thank you, sir, for your good wishes: yes, she is getting well now. And
I--I beg your pardon, sir--I think I heard you just now say to Madame Bent (the
window is open) that you found it difficult to get a governess for your house.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My people find it so. Why?--do you know of one?&quot; he added, smiling.</p>
<p>&quot;I think I do, sir.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mrs. Castlemaine is very difficult to please, especially as regards French,&quot;
he said still smiling; &quot;and the French of some of the ladies who have applied
has turned out to be very English French, so they would not suit her. Should you
chance to know of any one really eligible, madam, you would be conferring a
favour in introducing the lady to the notice of Mrs. Castlemaine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sir, I will think of it.&quot;</p>
<p>He lifted his hat again as he wished her good-day. And Madame Guise, gazing
after him, thought again that Heaven was surely working for her, in thus opening
a prospect of entrance to the house of Mr. Castlemaine.</p>
<br>
<br>

<h4><a name="div1_15" href="#div1Ref_15">CHAPTER XV.</a></h4>
<h5>GETTING IN BY DECEIT.</h5>
<br>

<p>Turning out of the Dolphin Inn, by its front entrance, went Charlotte Guise,
in her morning attire. It was a bright afternoon, and the fields were green
again. They lay on either side her road--the inland coach road that the stage
was wont to traverse. Leaving Mr. Parker's house on her left--for it was in this
spot that the doctor's residence was situated--she presently came to the turning
to Greylands' Rest, and passed on up the avenue. It was a wide avenue, and not
far short of half a mile in length, with trees on either side; oak, elm, birch,
larch, poplar, lime, and others. At its end was the gate admitting to the domain
of Greylands' Rest.</p>
<p>The house lay still and quiet in the sunshine. Madame Guise looked at it with
yearning eyes, for it was the place that had probably cost her poor husband his
life. But for putting in his claim to it, he might be living yet: and whether
that claim was a right or a wrong one, she hoped with her whole heart would be
proved before she herself should die. Opening the gate, and passing round the
fine green lawn, among the seats, the trees, the shrubs and the flower-beds, she
gained the porch entrance. Miles answered her ring at the bell.</p>
<p>&quot;Can I see Mrs. Castlemaine?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mrs. Castlemaine is out in the carriage, ma'am. Mr. Castlemaine is at home.&quot;</p>
<p>Hesitating a moment, for the very name of the Master of Greylands carried to
the heart of Charlotte Guise a shrinking dread, and yet fearful lest delay might
cause her application to be too late, she said she would be glad to speak with
Mr. Castlemaine. Miles admitted her into the hall--a good, old-fashioned room,
with a wood fire blazing in it. Along a passage to the right lay the
drawing-room, and into this room Miles ushered the lady.</p>
<p>Mrs. Castlemaine generally went out for a drive once a day. This afternoon
she had taken Flora; whose face was adorned with sundry patches of
sticking-plaster, the result of the fall off the ladder. In the red parlour sat
Ethel Reene, painting flowers on cardboard for a hand-screen: and the Master of
Greylands stood with his back to the fire, talking with her. They were speaking
of Miss Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;Papa, I do not think we must hope it,&quot; Ethel was saying. &quot;Rely upon it, Mary
will not come out again.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Castlemaine's face darkened at the words. Though holding the same
conviction himself, the step his niece had taken in entering the Nunnery was so
unpalatable to him that he could not bear to hear the opinion confirmed or
alluded to. He hated the Grey Sisters. He would have rid Greylands of their
presence, had it been in his power.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a sin, so to waste her life!&quot; he said, his deep tones betraying his
mortification. &quot;Ethel, I think we cannot have made her happy here.</p>
<p>&quot;It was nothing of that, papa. She told me she had been cherishing the idea
before she came to Greylands.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A meddling, tattling, tabby-cat set of women! Mary Ursula ought to----Well,
what now, Miles?&quot; For the man had entered the room and was waiting to speak.</p>
<p>&quot;A lady has come here, sir, asking to see Mrs. Castlemaine. When I said the
mistress was out, she said she would be glad to speak a few words to you. She is
in the drawing-room, sir.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What lady is it?&quot; returned the Master of Greylands.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, sir, I'm not altogether sure, but I fancy it is the one staying at the
Dolphin; her with the sick child. Anyway, she's a very nice, pleasant-looking
young lady, sir, whoever it is.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sure I don't know what she can want with me,&quot; remarked Mr. Castlemaine,
as he walked off to the drawing-room, and laid his hand on the door. But thought
is quick: and a fancy of what might have brought her here came across his mind
ere he turned the handle.</p>
<p>She was seated near the fire in the handsome but low-ceilinged room; her face
studiously turned from the one conspicuous portrait that hung opposite the
chimney-glass, for its likeness to her husband had struck on her with a chill.
She rose at Mr. Castlemaine's entrance and curtseyed as only a Frenchwoman can
curtsey. He saw an elegant looking young woman with a pleasing countenance and
somewhat shrinking manner. Mr. Castlemaine took her to be timid; probably unused
to society: for in these, the opening minutes of the interview, she trembled
visibly. He, of course, had heard with the rest of Greylands, of the lady
traveller who had cut short her journey at the Dolphin Inn an consequence of the
illness of her child, and who was supposed to be going on again as soon as she
could. Mr. Castlemaine had thought no more about it than that. But the idea that
crossed him now was, that this lady, having to encounter the detention at the
inn, might be finding herself short of funds to pursue her journey, and had come
to apply to him in the difficulty. Readily, would he have responded; for he had
a generous hand, an open heart. To hear, therefore, what the real object of her
visit was--that of soliciting the situation of governess, vacant in his
household, surprised him not a little.</p>
<p>The tale she told was plausible. Mr. Castlemaine, utterly unsuspicious in
regard to her, doubted nothing of its truth. The lady made a favourable
impression on him, and he was very courteous to her.</p>
<p>She was a widow, she said: and she had come over from Paris to this country
for two objects. One was to seek out a relative that she believed was somewhere
in it, though she did not know for certain whether he was dead or alive; the
other was to obtain employment as a governess--for she had been given to
understand that good French governesses were at a premium in the English
country, and her own means were but slender, not adequate to the support of
herself and little girl. Journeying along by coach, she had found her child
attacked with fever, which compelled her to halt at Greylands. Liking the place,
perceiving that it was open and healthy, she had been thinking that she should
do well to keep her child in it for a time, and therefore was hoping to make her
arrangements to do so. Should she be so fortunate as to obtain the post in Mr.
Castlemaine's household, the thing would be easy. Very plausibly did she tell
the tale; turning, however, hot and cold alternately all the while, and
detesting herself for the abhorred deceit.</p>
<p>&quot;But--pardon me, madam--what, in that case, would you do with the child?&quot;
asked Mr. Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;I would place her at nurse with some good woman, sir. That would not be
difficult. And the little thing would enjoy all the benefit of the sea-air. In
my country, children are more frequently brought up at nurse than at home.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have heard so,&quot; observed Mr. Castlemaine. &quot;You speak English remarkably
well, madam, for a Frenchwoman. Have you been much in this country?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Never before, sir. My mother was English, and she always talked to me in her
own tongue. I was reared in her faith--the protestant. My father was French, and
a Catholic. Upon their marriage it was agreed that, of the children to be born,
the boys should be brought up in his faith and the girls in hers. There came no
boy, however; and only one girl--me.&quot;</p>
<p>All this was true. Madame Guise did not add, for it was unnecessary, that
towards the close of her father's life he entered into large speculations, and
became a ruined man. He and her mother were both dead now. She said just what
she was obliged to say, and no more.</p>
<p>&quot;And it is. I presume, to see your mother's relatives that you have come to
England?&quot; pursued Mr. Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; she answered after a moment of hesitation; for it came indeed
hard to Charlotte Guise to tell a deliberate untruth, although necessity might
justify it. &quot;My mother used to talk much of one relative that she had here--a
brother. He may not be living now: I do not know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In what part of England did he live?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think he must have been a traveller, sir, for he seemed to move about. We
would hear of him, now in the south of England, now in the north, and now in the
west. Mostly he seemed to be in what my mother called remote
countries--Cumberland and Westmoreland.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Cumberland and Westmoreland!&quot; echoed Mr. Castlemaine. &quot;Dear me! And have you
no better clue to him than that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No better, sir; no other. I do not, I say, know whether he is dead or
alive.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it seems--pardon me--to be a somewhat wild-goose chase that you have
entered on, this search for him. What is his name?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My mother's maiden name was Williams. He was her brother.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Castlemaine shook his head. &quot;A not at all uncommon name,&quot; he said, &quot;and I
fear, madam, you might find some difficulty in tracing him out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I fear so. I find those places are very far off. At any rate, I will
not think more of it for the present. My little child, I see it now, is too
young to travel.&quot;</p>
<p>In all this account, Madame Guise had spoken the simple truth. The facts were
as she stated. The only falsehood in it was, the representation that it was this
relative, this never-yet-met uncle, she had come over to search out. During her
long journey, through France, she had said to herself that after she had found
her husband, they might perhaps go together to seek her uncle: but that was all.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, the little one is too young and delicate to travel,&quot; pursued Madame
Guise, &quot;and I dare not take her on. This illness of hers has frightened me, and
I shall, if possible, remain here by the sea.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I presume, madam--pardon me--that you were hoping to obtain help from this
uncle.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; was the answer, given falteringly. &quot;Should you admit me into your
house, sir, I will do my best to help on the studies of your daughter.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But--will you reconcile yourself to fill a situation of this kind in a
stranger's house after having ruled in a home of your own?&quot; questioned Mr.
Castlemaine, considerately, as he remembered his wife's domineering and
difficult temper.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, sir, the beggars, you know, must not be the choosers. I must do
something to keep me, and I would like to do this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The salary Mrs. Castlemaine offers is fifty guineas.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It seems a large sum to me, sir,&quot; was the truthful and candid answer.
&quot;Appointments in France, a very few excepted, are not so highly paid as in
England. I should of course be permitted to go out to see my child?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dear me, yes: whenever you pleased, madam. You would be quite at liberty
here--be as one of ourselves entirely. Mrs. Castlemaine--but here she is;
returning home.&quot;</p>
<p>The Master of Greylands had heard the carriage drawing up. He quitted the
room, and said a few hasty words to his wife of what had occurred. Mrs.
Castlemaine, much taken with the project, came in, in her black satin pelisse,
coated with crape. She sat down and put a few questions as to the applicant's
acquirements.</p>
<p>&quot;I am a brilliant pianist, madam, as I know you sometimes phrase it in your
country,&quot; said Madame Guise. &quot;My French is of course pure; and I could teach
dancing. Not drawing; I do not understand it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Drawing is quite a minor consideration,&quot; replied Mrs. Castlemaine. &quot;Could
you undertake the English?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why not, madam? I am nearly as well read in English as in French. And I am
clever at embroidery, and other kinds of fine and fancy needlework.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you fully understand that you would have to undertake Miss Reene's music
also? She is my stepdaughter.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It would be a pleasure to me, madam. I am fond of music.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Castlemaine came into the room again at this juncture. &quot;What part of
France have you lived in?&quot; he asked. &quot;Did I understand you to say in Paris?&quot;</p>
<p>Another necessary lie, or next door to one, for Charlotte Guise! Were she to
say, &quot;My native province is that of the Dauphin, and I have lived near Gap,&quot; it
might open their eyes to suspicion at once. She swallowed down a cough that
rose, partly choking her.</p>
<p>&quot;Not quite in Paris, sir. A little beyond it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And--pardon me--could you give references?&quot; Madame Guise looked up
helplessly. The colour rose in her face; for the fear of losing the appointment
became very present to her.</p>
<p>&quot;I know not how. I never was a governess before; and in that respect no one
could speak for me. I am of respectable family: my father was a rentier, and
much considered. For myself, I am of discreet conduct and manners,--surely you
cannot doubt it,&quot; she added, the tears of emotion rising to her eyes, as she
looked at them.</p>
<p>They looked back in return: Mr. Castlemaine thinking what a nice, ladylike,
earnest woman she was, one he could take on trust; Mrs. Castlemaine, entirely
seduced by the prospect of the pure French for Flora, eagerly wanting to ratify
the bargain. Madame Guise mistook the silence, supposing they were hesitating.</p>
<p>&quot;I could have a letter written to you from Paris,&quot; she said. &quot;I possess a
friend there, who will, I am sure, satisfy you that I am of good conduct and
family. Would there be more than this required?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not <i>any</i> more, it would be <i>quite</i> sufficient,&quot; Mrs. Castlemaine
hastened to say with emphasis. And, without waiting for the promised
letter--which, as she observed could come later--she engaged the governess on
the spot. Mr. Castlemaine attended Madame Guise to the door: and never a
suspicion crossed him that she was--who she was. How should it? How was he
likely to connect this lady-traveller--detained at the place by accident, so shy
in manner, so evidently distressed for her child--with the unfortunate Anthony,
lost since that fatal February night?</p>
<p>Madame Guise went out from the interview. In some respects it had not been
satisfactory: or, rather, not in accordance with her ante-impressions. She had
gone to it picturing Mr. Castlemaine as some great monster of iniquity, some
crafty, cruel, sinister man, from whom the world might shrink. She found him a
very good-looking, pleasing, and polished gentleman, with a high-bred air, a
kind and apparently sincere manner, and with the wonderful face-resemblance to
his brother Basil and to her own poor husband. How had it been possible, she
asked herself, for so apparently correct a man to commit that most dreadful
crime, and still be what he was? How wickedly deceitful some great criminals
were!</p>
<p>Mrs. Bent, when consulted, made strong objection to the nursing scheme,
expressing a most decided opinion against it. &quot;Put the sweet little child to any
one of those old women! Why, the next news we got would be that she had been let
roll down the cliff, or had fell into the sea! I should not like to risk it for
a child of mine, ma'am.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I must do something with her,&quot; said Madame Guise, setting her lips tightly.
Give up her plan, she would not; she believed Heaven itself had aided her in it;
but no one knew how much it cost her to part with this great treasure, her
child. From the hour of its birth, it had never been away from her. The devotion
of some French women to their children seems as remarkable as is the neglect of
others.</p>
<p>&quot;There's one thing you might do with her, ma'am, if you chose--and a far
better thing too than consigning her to any old nurse-woman.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What is that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I'll take the liberty of suggesting it,&quot; cried Mrs. Bent. &quot;Put her to
the Grey Sisters.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Grey Sisters!&quot; echoed Madame Guise, struck with the suggestion. &quot;But
would they take one so young, think you? A little child who can scarcely speak!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think they'd take her and be glad of it. Why, ma'am, children are like
playthings to them. They have the fishermen's children there by day to teach and
train; and they keep 'em by night too when the little ones are sick.&quot;</p>
<p>No suggestion could have been more welcome to Madame Guise. The wonder was,
that she had not herself thought of it: she no doubt would have done so had
Marie been older. To put the matter at rest, she went over at once to the
Nunnery. Sister Charlotte received her, and heard her proposal joyfully.</p>
<p>Admit a dear little child as boarder amongst them! Yes, that they would; and
take the most loving care; and train her, they hoped, to find the road to
Heaven. They would be glad to have two or three little ones of the better class,
no matter what the age; the bit of money paid for them would be an assistance,
for the Sisterhood was but poor. Though, indeed, now that the new Sister, Mary
Ursula--Miss Castlemaine--had joined them, they were better off.</p>
<p>&quot;I am so glad to hear you say she may come,&quot; said Madame Guise. &quot;I had feared
my little one was too young. She must have everything done for her, and she
cannot speak plainly. English she does not speak at all, though she understands
it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She will soon speak it with us: and we will try and make her quite happy.
But I must summon our Superior,&quot; added Sister Charlotte, &quot;for I may not take
upon myself to decide this, though I know how welcome it will be.&quot;</p>
<p>The Superior came in, in the person of Miss Castlemaine.</p>
<p>Alas, no longer to be called so--but Sister Mary Ursula. She swept in, in her
silk mourning dress, and with the muslin cap shading her beautiful hair, and
greeted Madame Guise with all her winning and gracious manner, holding out her
hand in welcome. In some turn of the face, or in some glance of the eye--it was
hard to define what--so strong a likeness to the lost and ill-fated Anthony
momentarily shone out from Miss Castlemaine's countenance, that poor Madame
Guise felt faint. But she had to control all feeling now; she had passed into
another character and left herself out of sight behind.</p>
<p>Seated opposite to her, giving to her her best attention, her fine head
gently bent, her soft, but brilliant eyes thrown upon her, Sister Mary Ursula
listened to the story Madame Guise told. She had engaged herself as governess at
Greylands' Rest, and wished to be allowed to place her child with the Grey
Ladies.</p>
<p>&quot;Is the situation at Greylands' Rest one that you think will suit you?--do
you feel that it is what you will like to undertake?&quot; Miss Castlemaine inquired
when the speaker paused: for at the first moment she had thought that it was
only her opinion that was being asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I do. I am very much pleased to have obtained it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then I can only say that I hope you will be happy in it, and find it all you
can wish. I am sure you will like my uncle. Your pupil, Miss Flora Castlemaine,
is self-willed, and has been much indulged by her mother. You will be able, I
trust, to bring her to better ways.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you will take my little girl, madam?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly. It is very good of you to confide her to us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is very good of you to agree to take her, madam. I am so glad! And how
much shall I pay you for her? Say by the trimestre--the three months?&quot;</p>
<p>Miss Castlemaine shook her head with a smile. &quot;I have not been here long
enough to act on my own judgment,&quot; she said: &quot;upon all knotty points I consult
Sister Mildred. We will let you know in the course of the day.&quot;</p>
<p>Madame Guise rose. But for the dreadful suspicion that lay upon her, the
crime she was going out of her own character to track, she would have liked to
throw herself into the arms of this gracious lady, and say with tears, &quot;You are
my husband's cousin. Oh, pity me, for I was Anthony's wife!&quot; But it might not
be. She had entered on her task, and must go through with it.</p>
<p>And when a dainty little note in Sister Margaret's writing was brought over
to the Dolphin in the evening by Sister Ann, Madame Guise found that the ladies
had fixed a very small sum as payment for her child--four pounds the quarter:
or, sixteen pounds the year.</p>
<p>&quot;Cent francs par trimestre,&quot; commented Madame Guise in her own language. &quot;It
is quite moderate: but Marie is but a little one.&quot;</p>
<p>The child went over on the following day. She was entered as Mademoiselle
Marie Guise. Very much astonished would those good ladies have been had they
known her true name to be that of their Superior--Mary Ursula Castlemaine! There
was no fear of the child betraying secrets. She was a very backward child, not
only in speech; she seemed to have forgotten all about her father, and she could
not have told the name of her native place, where it was, or anything about it,
if questioned over so. Trouble was expected with her at the parting. Her mother
was advised not to attempt to see her for some three or four days after she went
over to the Nunnery: but rather to give her time to get reconciled to the
change, and to this new abode.</p>
<p>It was cruel penance to the mother, this parting; worse than it could have
been to the child. Those who understand the affection of some French mothers for
their children, and who remember that the little ones never leave their side,
will know what this must have been for Charlotte Guise. She saw Marie at a
distance on the following day, Sunday--for it happened to be Saturday that the
child went in. The little church was filled at the three o'clock afternoon
service, when Parson Marston gabbled through the prayers and the sermon to the
edification of his flock. Little Marie sat in the large pew with the Grey
ladies, between Sister Mary Ursula in her black attire, and Sister Betsey in her
grey. The latter who had a special love for children, had taken the little one
under her particular charge. Marie was in black also: and a keen observer might
have fancied there was some sort of likeness between her and the stately Head
Sister beside her. The child looked happy and contented. To the scandal of the
surrounders, no doubt far more to them than to that of the Parson himself, whose
mouth widened with a laugh, she, happening to espy out her mother when they were
standing up to say the belief, extended her hands, called out &quot;Maman! maman!&quot;
and began to nod incessantly. Sister Betsey succeeded in restoring decorum.</p>
<p>Madame Guise sat with Mr. and Mrs. Bent, occupying the post of honour at the
top of the pew. After that, she strove to hide herself from Marie. In the
square, crimson-curtained pew pertaining to Greylands' Rest, the only pew in the
church with any pretensions to grandeur, sat the Master of Greylands and his
family: his wife with a pinched face, for she had contrived to take cold; Harry,
tall as himself, free and fascinating; Flora staring about with the plaster
patches on her face; and Ethel Reene, devout, modest, lovely. They were all in
black: the mourning worn for Mr. Peter Castlemaine. Their servants, also in
mourning, occupied a pew behind that of the Grey Ladies. It might have been
noticed that Mr. Castlemaine never once turned his head towards these ladies: he
had never favoured them, and the step taken by his niece in joining their
society had vexed him more materially than he would have liked to say. He had
his private reasons for it: he had cause to wish those ladies backs turned on
Greylands; but he had no power to urge their departure openly, or to send them
by force away.</p>
<p>Very dull was poor Charlotte Guise all that Sunday evening. She would not
meet the little one on coming out of church, but mixed with the people to avoid
it. Her heart yearned to give a fond word, a tender kiss; but so anxiously bent
was she upon entering Greylands' Rest, that she shrank from anything that might
impede it, or imperil the child's stay at the Nunnery. After taking tea in her
parlour, she sat awhile in her own room above stairs indulging her sadness. It
was sometimes worse than she knew how to bear. She might not give way to grief,
distress, anguish in the presence of the world; that might have betrayed her to
suspicion; but there were moments, when alone, that she yielded to it in all its
bitterness. The fathomless sea, calm to-night, was spread out before her, grey
and dull, for the rays of the setting sun had left it: did that sea cover the
body of him whom she had loved more than life? To her left rose the Friar's
Keep--she could almost catch a glimpse of its dark walls if she stretched her
head well out at the casement; at any rate, she could see this end of the Grey
Nunnery, and that was something. Did that Friar's Keep, with its dark tales, its
superstitions stories--did that Keep contain the mystery? She fully believed it
did. From the very first, the description of the building had seized on her
mind, and left its dread there. It was <i>there</i> she must look for the traces
of her husband's fate; perhaps even for himself. Yes, she believed that the grim
walls covered him, not the heaving sea.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh Anthony! my ill-fated, wronged husband!&quot; she cried, raising her clasped
hands upwards in her distress and speaking through her blinding tears, &quot;may the
good God help me to bring your fate to light!&quot;</p>
<p>The shades of twilight were deepening. Fishermen, with their wives and
children, were wending their way homewards after the Sunday evening's walk--the
one walk taken together of the seven days. Two of the Grey Ladies came down from
the cliff and went towards the Nunnery: Madame Guise, who by this time had made
acquaintance with some of the inhabitants, wondered whether anybody was ill in
the cottages there. A good many dwellings were scattered on this side of the
cliff: some of them pretty, commodious homes, others mere huts.</p>
<p>Once more, as she stood there at the casement window, Charlotte Guise asked
herself whether she was justified in thus entering Greylands' Rest under a false
aspect--justified even by the circumstances. She had revolved the question in
her mind many times during the past few days, and the answer had always been, as
it was now, in the affirmative. And she was of a straightforward, honourable
nature; although the reader may be disposed to judge the contrary. That Mr.
Castlemaine had taken her husband's life; taken it in wilful malice and
wickedness, that he might retain his usurpation of Greylands' Rest, she did not
entertain a shade of doubt of: she believed, religiously believed, that the
mission of tracking out this crime was laid upon her by Heaven: and she did
consider herself justified in taking any steps that might forward her in it; any
steps in the world, overhanded or underhanded, short of doing injury to any
innocent person. Her original resolve had been, merely to stay in the village,
seek out what information she could, and wait; but the opportunity having been
offered her in so singularly marked a manner (as she looked upon it) of becoming
an inmate of Mr. Castlemaine's home, she could not hesitate in embracing it. And
yet, though she never faltered in her course, though an angel from Heaven would
hardly have stopped her entrance, believing, as she did, that the entrance had
been specially opened for her, every now and again qualms of conscience pricked
her sharply, and she hated the whole proceeding.</p>
<p>&quot;But I cannot leave Anthony alone in the unknown grave,&quot; she would piteously
tell herself at these moments. &quot;And I can see no other way to discovery; and I
have no help from any one to aid me in it. If I entered upon the investigation
openly, declaring who I am, that might be worse than fruitless: it would put Mr.
Castlemaine on his guard; he is more clever than I, he has all power here, while
I have none; and Anthony might remain where he is, unavenged, for ever. No, no,
I must go on in my planned-out course.&quot;</p>
<p>The sea became more grey; the evening star grew bright in the sky; people had
gone within their homes and the doors were shut. Madame Guise, tired with the
wearily-passing hours, sick and sad at her own reflections, put on her bonnet
and warm mantle to take a bit of a stroll over to the beach. Mrs. Bent happened
to meet her as she gained the passage below. The landlady was looking so
unusually cross that Madame Guise noticed it.</p>
<p>&quot;I have been giving a word of a sort to Mr. Harry Castlemaine,&quot; she
explained, as they entered her sitting-room. &quot;You be quiet, John Bent: what I
see right to do, I shall do. Mr. Harry will go too far in that quarter if he
does not mind.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Young men like to talk to pretty girls all the world over; they did in my
time, I know, and they do in this,&quot; was John's peaceful answer, as he rose from
his fire-side chair at his guest's entrance. &quot;Bat I don't see, wife, that it's
any good reason for your pouncing upon Mr. Harry as he was going by to his home
and saying what you did.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Prevention's better than cure,&quot; observed Mrs. Bent, in a short tone. &quot;As to
young men liking to talk to pretty girls, that's all very well when they are
equals in life; but when it comes to a common sailor's daughter and a gentleman,
it's a different thing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Jane Hallet's father was not a common sailor!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He was not over much above it,&quot; retorted Mrs. Bent. &quot;Because the Grey
Sisters educated her and made much of her, would you exalt her into a lady? you
never had proper sense, John Bent, and never will have.</p>
<p>&quot;I call Miss Hallet a lady,&quot; said John.</p>
<p>&quot;You might call the moon a lantern if you chose, but you couldn't make other
folks do it. As to Jane, she is too pretty to be followed by Mr. Harry
Castlemaine. Why, he must have been walking with her nearly ever since tea!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He intends no harm, Dorothy, I'll answer for it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Harm comes sometimes without intention, John Bent. Mr. Harry's as
thoughtless and random as a March hare. I've seen what I have seen: and Jane
Hallet had better keep herself in future out of his company.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, your speaking to him did no good, wife. And it was not respectful.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good! it's not likely it would do good with him,&quot; conceded Mrs. Bent. &quot;He
turns everything into laughter. Did you hear how he began about my Sunday cap,
asking for the pattern of it, and setting Molly off in a grin! She nearly
dropped the scuttle of coals she was bringing in--good evening then, ma'am, for
the present, if you are going for your little stroll.&quot;</p>
<p>Madame Guise, leaving her host and hostess to settle their difference
touching Mr. Harry Castlemaine, went over to the beach and walked about there.
The shades grew deeper; the stars came out brightly: night was upon the earth
when she retraced her steps. Thinking of her little one, she did not go into the
inn, but walked past the Grey Nunnery: she knew she should not see the child,
but it was a satisfaction only to look at the window of the room that contained
her. Soon Madame Guise came to the gate of the chapel ruins; and some impulse
prompted her to open it and enter. But she first of all looked cautiously around
to make sure she was not being watched: once let it be known that she held any
particular interest in this place, and her connection with him who had been lost
within it might be suspected! When we hold a dangerous secret, the conscience is
more than sensitive: and Madame Guise was no exception to the rule.</p>
<p>She crossed the ruins, and stood looking out on the sea, so grand from
thence. It was low water; she saw the rude steps by which the little beach below
might be gained, but would not have liked to venture down. The steps were
hazardous for even a strong man, and perhaps were not used from one month's end
to another: the slime and sea-weed made them slippery. After she had gazed her
fill, she turned to the Friar's Keep, and made her way into it by the gothic
door between the once firm walls.</p>
<p>Oh, but it was dark here! By what she could make out, when her sight got used
to the gloom, she seemed to be amidst the arches of some pillared cloisters.
While looking on this side and that side, striving to pierce the mysteries,
taking a step this way and a step that, and trembling all the while lest she
should see the revenant, said to haunt the place, a dreadful sound, like the
huge fluttering of large wings, arose above in the arches. Poor Charlotte Guise,
superstitious by nature and education, and but young in years yet, was seized
with a perfect acme of terror; of terror too great to scream. Was it the spirit
of her husband, striving to communicate with her, she wondered--and oh blame her
not too greatly. She had been reared in the fear of &quot;revenants;&quot; she earnestly
believed that the dead were sometimes permitted to revisit the earth. Silence
supervened, and her terror grew somewhat less intense. &quot;Is your grave here,
Anthony?&quot; she murmured; &quot;are you buried in some corner of this lonesome place,
away from the eye of man? Oh, hear me while I repeat my vow to search out this
dreadful mystery! To the utmost of the power that circumstances and secrecy
leave me, will I strive to find you, Anthony; and bring home to Mr.
Castlemaine----&quot;</p>
<p>A worse noise than before; an awful fluttering and flapping right above her
head. She screamed out now, terrified nearly to death. The echoes repeated her
scream; and the rushing wings, with another kind of scream, not half so shrill
as hers, went out through the broken wall and flew across the sea. She felt just
as though she were dropping into her grave. Was it the revenant of the
place?--or was it the revenant of her husband?--<i>what</i> was it? Cowering
there, her face prone against a column, Charlotte asked herself these dread
questions: and never once, until her alarm was somewhat subsiding, did she think
of what her reason might have shown her at first--that it was an owl. An owl,
angry at its precincts being invaded: or perhaps some large sea-bird.</p>
<p>With her face as white as death, and her limbs shaking as though in an ague
fit, she made her way to the entrance gate again; passed through it, and so got
away from the Friar's Keep.</p>
<br>

<h5>AT GREYLANDS' REST.</h5>
<br>

<p>&quot;Now, mademoiselle, je n'eh veux pas.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because Ethel understands French as well as you do, that's no reason why I
should. If you tell me in French what I have to do, of course I can't do it, for
I don't know a word you say.&quot;</p>
<p>It was the first morning of the studies, Tuesday, Madame Guise having entered
the previous day. She, Ethel, and Flora were seated round the table in the
schoolroom, a small apartment looking to the kitchen-garden, with an old carpet
on its floor, painted segged chairs, and a square piano against the wall
opposite the fire. Ethel was copying music. Madame Guise was endeavouring to
ascertain the advancement of Miss Flora in her studies, with a view to arranging
their course in future, speaking in French, and requiring the replies to be in
French. But the young lady obstinately persisted in making them in English.</p>
<p>&quot;Whatever you do, Madame Guise, please speak <i>always</i> to Flora in
French,&quot; had been Mrs. Castlemaine's first charge to the new governess. &quot;Above
all things, I wish her to be a good French scholar, and to speak it as fluently
as Miss Reene does.&quot; But here, at the very outset, Miss Flora was demurring to
the French, and protesting she could not understand it.</p>
<p>Madame Guise hesitated. She did not choose to be met by wilful disobedience;
on the other hand, to issue her mandates in an unknown language would be simply
waste of time. She turned her eyes questioningly on Ethel. &quot;I am not quite sure,
madame, one way or the other,&quot; said Ethel, replying in French. &quot;Flora ought to
be able to understand it; and to speak it a little too; but she has always been
inattentive. Miss Oldham and the governesses who preceded her did not speak
French as you do: perhaps they were not particular that Flora should speak it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How is it that you speak it so well?&quot; asked Madame.</p>
<p>&quot;I? Oh, I had a French nurse when I was a child, and then a French governess;
and to finish my education I went to Paris for two years.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All the three governesses I have had here did not speak French to me,&quot;
interrupted Flora, resentfully. &quot;Not one of them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Have you had three governesses? That is a great many, considering you are
yet young,&quot; observed Madame, in English.</p>
<p>&quot;They were all bad ones,&quot; said the girl.</p>
<p>&quot;Or was it that you were a bad pupil You must be a better one with me.&quot;</p>
<p>Ethers shapely head, with its bright dark hair, was bent over her copying
again: she said nothing. Madame Guise determined to speak in English to the
child for at least this morning, until the studies should be put in train.</p>
<p>&quot;We will begin with your English grammar&quot;--taking up the dog-eared, untidy
book. &quot;How far have you advanced in it, Miss Flora?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't like grammar.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How far have you advanced in it?&quot; equably pursued Madame.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't recollect.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To begin English grammar again,&quot; spoke Madame, addressing herself, and
making a note on paper with a pencil.</p>
<p>&quot;I shan't begin it again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You will not say to me I shall or I shan't; you will do what I please,&quot;
quietly corrected Madame. &quot;This is your English History. What reign are you in?&quot;</p>
<p>Miss Flora had her elbows on the table, her hands under her chin, and her
pretty face pushed out defiantly opposite Madame. The patches of plaster were
nearly all gone; her light curls tied back with a black ribbon, hang low behind.
She wore a black frock and white pinafore.</p>
<p>&quot;Which of the king's reigns are you in?&quot; pursued Madame.</p>
<p>&quot;Not in any. I know them all. Charles the Second was beheaded; and Henry the
Eighth had ten wives: and Guy Faux blew up the gunpowder plot; and Elizabeth
boxed people's ears.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said Madame, &quot;I think we shall have to begin <i>that</i> again. Are you
good at spelling?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can't spell at all. I hate it. Mamma says I need not learn to spell.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I fancy that cannot be true. How will you write letters if you cannot
spell?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who wants to write letters?--I don't.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Flora!&quot; put in Ethel in a warning tone.</p>
<p>The girl turned angrily on Ethel. &quot;Nobody asked <i>you</i> to speak: mind
your copying.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mind your manners, said Ethel nodding to her.</p>
<p>&quot;Not for you, or for anybody else in this room.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is very unpleasant to hear young ladies say these rude things,&quot;
interposed Madame. &quot;As your governess, Miss Flora, I shall not permit it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's what my other governesses would say,&quot; retorted Flora. &quot;It made no
difference to me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If the other governesses did not do their duty by you, it is no reason why I
should not do mine,&quot; said Madame. &quot;Your papa has charged me with forming your
manners; if I have trouble in doing it I am to appeal to him.&quot;</p>
<p>Flora was silent. The one only authority she feared, in the house or out of
it, was her father's. <i>He</i> would not be trifled with, however her mother
might be.</p>
<p>&quot;I hate governesses, Madame Guise. I'd like to know what they were invented
for?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To teach ignorant and refractory children to become good young ladies,&quot;
spoke Madame, who did not seem in the least to lose her temper. Flora did not
like the calmness: it augured badly for the future. It was so totally unlike her
experience of former governesses. <i>They</i> were either driven wild, or had
subsided into a state of apathy.</p>
<p>&quot;I drove those other governesses away, and I'll drive you. I'll never do
anything you tell me. I won't learn and I won't practise.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The less you learn, the more persistently I will stay on to make you,&quot; said
Madame, quite unruffled. &quot;A lesson that you do not get by heart to-day, you will
have to get to-morrow: the studies broken off this week, must be completed next.
As to your trying to drive me away, it will be labour lost; I simply tell you I
am not to be driven. If there is anything I like, and for which I think I have
an especial fitness, it is the ruling of refractory children. We shall see which
will be strongest, Miss Flora, you or I.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Once, when one of my governesses wanted to <i>make</i> me learn, I had a
fever. Mamma said it was all her fault.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very good,&quot; said Madame. &quot;We will risk the fever. If you get one I will
nurse you through it. I am a capital nurse.&quot;</p>
<p>Ethel burst out laughing. &quot;The fever was a headache, Flora; you brought it on
with crying.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You ugly story-teller! I did have a fever. I lay in bed and had broth.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, for a day. Why, you have never had a fever in your life. Mr. Parker saw
you and brought some medicine; you would not take it and got up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ugh! you old tell-tale!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Come to my side, Miss Flora,&quot; spoke Madame. &quot;You will stand here and read a
little of French and of English that I may see how you read. And I must tell you
that if we have not got through this morning what we want to get through and put
the studies en train, I shall not allow you to go out this afternoon, and I
shall request that you have no dinner. Instead of that, you will stay in this
room with me. Mind! I never break my word.&quot;</p>
<p>After a few moments' delay, the young lady moved round. Probably she saw that
her new mistress was <i>not</i> one to break her word. And, thus, a beginning
made, the morning wore away rather better than its commencement had promised.
Never was there a child with better abilities than Flora Castlemaine: it was
only the will to use them that was lacking. She had been brought up to exercise
her own will and disobey that of others. Bad training! bad training for a child.</p>
<p>Putting aside the difficulties attending the instruction and management of
Miss Flora, Madame Guise found the residence at Greylands' Rest not at all an
unpleasant one. The routine of the day was this. Breakfast--which meal was taken
all together in the red parlour--at eight o'clock. Flora until dinner-time;
half-past one. Ethel's music lesson of an hour, was given during the afternoon:
Flora being generally out with her mamma or racing about the premises and
grounds on her own account. Tea at five; one hour given to Flora afterwards, to
help her to prepare her lessons or exercises for the following day: and then
Madame's duties were over.</p>
<p>Little did Mr. Castlemaine imagine that the pleasant, though always sad young
lady, who was so efficient an instructress for the young plague of the house,
was his ill-fated nephew's widow. He was somewhat taken aback when he heard that
Madame Guise had placed her child at the Grey Nunnery, and knitted his brow in
displeasure. However, the child's being there, so long as the ladies were, could
make no difference to him; it was the Sisterhood he wanted away, not the child.</p>
<p>Charlotte Guise never went out during the day--except on Sundays to church.
Ethel would try to coax her abroad in the afternoons, but hitherto she had not
succeeded. In the evening, after Flora was done with, Madame would put her
bonnet on and stroll alone: sometimes to the Nunnery to see her child, whose
enforced absence only made her the dearer to her mother's heart.</p>
<p>&quot;Why will you not go out with me?&quot; asked Ethel one afternoon, when she and
Madame Guise rose from the piano in the red parlour--for the old square piano in
the schoolroom was for the benefit of the unskilled fingers of Miss Flora only.
&quot;See how pleasant everything looks! It is quite spring weather now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, it is spring weather, but I feel a little cold always, and I don't care
to go,&quot; answered Madame Guise. &quot;I will go when summer comes.&quot;</p>
<p>They sat down before the French window, Ethel opening it to the pleasant air.
Madame Guise had been wishing ever since she was in the house to put a question
to this fair young girl, whom she had already learned to love. But she had not
yet dared to do it: conscience was always suggesting fears of her true identity
being discovered: and now that she did speak it was abruptly.</p>
<p>&quot;Have any tidings been heard yet of the young man said to have been lost in
the Friar's Keep?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, not any,&quot; replied Ethel.</p>
<p>&quot;Is it true, think you, that he was killed?&quot;</p>
<p>Ethel Reene flushed painfully: she could not forget what she had overheard
John Bent say.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I hope not. Of course, his disappearance is very strange; more than
strange. But if--if anything did happen to him that night, it might have been by
accident.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I heard about the matter when I was at the Dolphin,&quot; observed Madame Guise,
as if wishing to account for speaking of it. &quot;It took much hold upon my
interest; it seemed so strange and sad. Did you ever see that Mr. Anthony,
Ethel?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I saw him twice. I was prejudiced against him at first, but I grew to
like him. I should have liked him very much had he lived; I am sure of it: quite
as a brother. Miss Castlemaine of Stilborough liked him: and I think the mystery
of his loss has lain heavily upon her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What prejudiced you against him?&quot; asked Charlotte.</p>
<p>Ethel smiled, and told the tale. She gave the history of their two meetings;
gave it in detail. The tongue is ready when it has a sympathetic hearer: never a
more rapt one than she who listened now.</p>
<p>Ethel rose as she concluded it. The disappearance was a subject she did not
care to speak of, or dwell upon. Unable to believe Mr. Castlemaine otherwise
than innocent, she yet saw that a prejudice had arisen against him.</p>
<p>&quot;Then you will not come out with me, madame?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Many thanks, but no.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What will you do with yourself all day to-morrow?&quot; asked Ethel.</p>
<p>&quot;I shall take holiday,&quot; replied Madame Guise, with a flush of colour.</p>
<p>For on the morrow the whole of the family were going from home, having
promised to spend the day with some friends who lived near Newerton.</p>
<p>The flush had been caused by Charlotte Guise's self-consciousness. True, she
would take holiday on the morrow from her duties; that went as a matter of
course; but she was purposing to use the day, or part of it, in endeavouring to
make some discovery. These twelve days had she been in the house now, and she
was no farther advanced than when she entered it. She had seen Mr. Castlemaine
daily; she had conversed with him, dined and taken other meals in his company;
but for all the enlightenment she had obtained, or the new ideas she had
gathered of the doings of that ill-fated February night, he and she might as
well have been far apart as are the two poles. It was not by going on in this
tame way that she could hope to obtain any clue to the past: the past to which
she had made a vow to devote herself.</p>
<p>The morning rose brightly, and the family went off after breakfast in the
carriage, Harry sitting on the box with the coachman. Madame Guise was left
alone.</p>
<p>A feverish desire had been upon her to enter Mr. Castlemaine's room upstairs;
the study where he kept the accounts pertaining to the estate, and wrote his
letters. In this room he passed many hours daily, sitting in it sometimes late
into the night. Charlotte Guise held an impression that if she could find tokens
or records of her lost husband, it would be there. But she had never yet
obtained so much as a glimpse of its interior: the room was considered sacred to
Mr. Castlemaine, and the family did not approach it.</p>
<p>Two or three of the women servants had obtained permission to absent
themselves that day to visit their friends; and the house was comparatively
deserted. Madame Guise, looking forth from her chamber, found all silent and
still: the upstairs work was over; the servants, those who remained at home,
were shut up in the remote kitchens. Now was her time; now, if ever.</p>
<p>The corridor was spacious. It ran along two sides of the house, and most of
the bed chambers opened from it. Mr. Castlemaine's study was the middle room in
the side corridor; Madame's bedroom was nearly opposite the room; the one beyond
hers being Harry Castlemaine's.</p>
<p>Standing outside her door, in the still silence, with a flushed face and
panting breath, not liking the work she was about to do, but believing it a
necessity thrown upon her, she at length softly crossed the corridor and opened
the outer door leading to the study. A short, dark, narrow passage not much more
than a yard in length, and there was another door. This was locked, but the key
was in it; she turned the key, and entered the room. Entered it with some
undefined feeling of disappointment, for it was bare and empty.</p>
<p>We are all apt to form ideas of places and things as yet unseen. The picture
of Mr. Castlemaine's study, in the mind of Charlotte Guise, had been of a
spacious apartment filled with furniture, and littered with papers. What she saw
was a small square room, and no earthly thing in it, papers or else, but two
tables, some chairs, and a bureau against the wall: or what would have been
called in her own land a large secretaire, or office desk. She gazed around her
with a blank face.</p>
<p>The tables and chairs were bare: no opportunity <i>there</i> for anything
concealed. The bureau was locked. She tried it; palled it, pushed it: but the
closed-down lid was firm as adamant.</p>
<p>&quot;If there exists any record of him, it is in here,&quot; she said, half aloud. &quot;I
must contrive means of opening it.&quot;</p>
<p>She could not do that to-day. It would have to be done with a false key, she
supposed; and, that, she had not in her possession. Before quitting the room,
she approached the window, and looked forth cautiously. At the sea rolling in
the distance; at the Friars' Keep opposite; at the fair green lands lying
between that and Greylands' Rest. Charlotte Guise shuddered at a thought that
crossed her.</p>
<p>&quot;If he did indeed kill my poor husband and has laid him to rest in the
Friars' Keep, how can he bear to be in this room, with that building in front of
him to remind him of the deed?&quot;</p>
<p>The day was before her: it was not yet twelve o'clock. Blankly disappointed
with her failure, she put on her things to go abroad: there was nothing to stay
in for. At the last moment a thought struck her that she would go to
Stilborough. She wanted to make some purchases; for the wardrobe brought over
from France had not been extensive, either for herself or child. Hastily
attiring herself, she told Miles she should not be in to dinner, and started.</p>
<p>And so, just as Anthony Castlemaine had once, and but once, set off to walk
to the market-town, did his poor young wife--nay, his widow--set off now. She
was a good walker, and, so far, enjoyed the journey and the sweet spring day.
She saw the same objects of interest (or of non-interest, as people might
estimate them) that he had seen: the tall, fine trees, now budding into life:
the country carts and waggons; the clumsy milestones; the two or three farm
houses lying back amid their barns and orchards. Thus she reached Stilborough,
and did her commissions.</p>
<p>It was late when she got back to Greylands; five o'clock, and she was dead
tired. By the time she reached the Dolphin, she could hardly drag one foot
before the other. To walk three miles on a fine day is not much; but to go about
afterwards from shop to shop, and then to walk back again is something more.
Mrs. Bent, standing at the inn door, saw her, brought her in, and set her down
to a substantial tea-table. She told the landlady she had been to Stilborough to
make purchases--which would come by the van for her on the morrow, and to be
left at the Dolphin, if the Dolphin would kindly take them in.</p>
<p>&quot;With pleasure,&quot; said Mrs. Bent. &quot;Ned shall take the parcels up to Greylands'
Rest.&quot;</p>
<p>What with the welcome rest to her tired limbs, and what with Mrs. Bent's
hospitable tea and gossip, Madame Guise sat longer than she had intended. It was
nearly dark when she went over to the Nunnery--for she had brought a toy and
some bonbons for Marie. The Grey Sisters received her as kindly as usual; but
they told her the little one did not seem very well; and Madame Guise went
upstairs to look at her. Marie was in her little bed, by the side of Sister
Betsey's. She seemed restless and feverish. Poor Charlotte Guise began to think
that perhaps this climate did not agree with her so well as their own. Taking
off her things, she sat down to stay with the child.</p>
<p>&quot;Mrs. Castlemaine said it would be quite midnight before they got home, as
they were to make a very long day, so I am in no hurry for an hour or two,&quot; she
observed. &quot;Miles will think I am lost; but I will tell him how it is.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Has your little one ever had the measles?&quot; asked Sister Mona.</p>
<p>&quot;The measles?&quot; repeated Madame Guise, puzzled for the moment. &quot;Oh, lea
rougeoles--pardon my forgetfulness--no she has not. She has never had anything.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then I think, but I am not sure, that she is sickening for the measles now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mon Dieu!&quot; cried the mother in consternation.</p>
<p>&quot;It is nothing,&quot; said the Sister. &quot;We have nursed dozens of children, and
brought them well through it. In a week little Marie will be about again.&quot;</p>
<p>But Madame Guise, unused to these light ailments, and terribly anxious for
her only child, whom she could but look upon, as separated from herself, in the
light of a martyr, was not easily reassured. She stayed with the child as long
as she dared, and begged that Mr. Parker might be sent for in the morning should
Marie be no better.</p>
<p>It was late to go home; after eleven; but nevertheless Charlotte Guise took
the lonely road past the Friars' Keep and up Chapel Lane. The way had a
fascination for her. Since she had been at Greylands' Rest, in going home from
the Nunnery in the evening she had always chosen it. What she expected to see or
hear, that could bear upon her husband's fate, she knew not; but the vague idea
ever lay upon her that she might light upon something. Could she have done it
without suspicion, three parts of her time would have been spent pacing about
before the chapel ruins, just as John Bent had paced the night he was waiting
for his guest.</p>
<p>It was very lonely. All the village had long ago been in bed. The stars were
bright; the night was light and clear. Looking over the chapel ruins, she could
see the lights of a distant vessel out at sea. Under the hedge, in the very
selfsame spot where her husband and John Bent had halted that fatal night, did
she now halt, and gaze across at the Keep, Chapel Lane being close upon her left
hand.</p>
<p>&quot;No, they could not have been mistaken,&quot; ran her thoughts. &quot;If Mr.
Castlemaine came down the lane now and crossed over, I should know him
unmistakably--and that night was lighter than this, almost like day, for the
moon, they say, was never brighter. Then why, unless he were guilty, should Mr.
Castlemaine deny that he was there?&quot;</p>
<p>Glancing up at the windows with a shudder, almost fearing she might see the
revenant of the Grey Monk pass them with his lamp, or some other revenant,
Madame Guise turned up Chapel Lane. At such moments, trifles serve to unstring
the nerves of a timorous woman. Sounds struck on Madame Guise's ear, and she
drew back, trembling and shaking, amid the thick grove of shrubs and trees
skirting one side of the lane.</p>
<p>&quot;Gently, now; gently, Bess,&quot; cried a voice not far from her. &quot;You shall go
your own pace in less than five minutes, old girl. Gently now.&quot;</p>
<p>And to Charlotte Guise's astonishment, she saw Commodore Teague's spring-cart
turn out of the dark turning that led from the Hutt, the Commodore driving. Its
cover looked white in the starlight; Bess, the mare he thought so much of, had
her best harness on. When nearly abreast of Madame Guise, the Commodore pulled
up with an exclamation.</p>
<p>&quot;The devil take it! I've forgot to lock the shed door. Stand still, old girl;
stand still, Bess.&quot;</p>
<p>He got down and ran back. The well-trained animal stood perfectly still. In a
few moments' time he was back again, had mounted, and was driving slowly away in
the direction of Newerton.</p>
<p>&quot;What can be taking him abroad at this night hour?&quot; Madame said to herself in
wonder.</p>
<p>But the encounter, though it had been a silent one, and on the man's part
unsuspected, had served to restore somewhat of her courage: the proximity of a
human being is so reassuring in the dark and lonely night, when superstitions
fancies are running riot. And with a swift step, Charlotte Guise proceeded on
her way up Chapel Lane.</p>

<h4><a name="div1_17" href="#div1Ref_17">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h4>
<h5>OPENING THE BUREAU.</h5>
<br>

<p>Greylands' Cliff was a high cliff: and the huts of the fishermen, nestling in
nooks on its side, rendered it very picturesque. Many a lover of art and nature,
seeking a subject for his pencil, had sketched this cliff; some few had made it
into a grand painting and sent it forth to charm the world.</p>
<p>The two highest cottages on it were of a superior order. Even they were not
built on the top; but close under it. They stood nearly side by side; a jutting
of rock stretching out between them. The walls were white: and to the side of
one of these dwellings--the one nearest the sea--there was a small square piece
of sunk level that served now for a little garden. Miss Hallet, to whom the
cottage belonged, had caused some loads of good earth to be brought up; she
planted a few flowers, a few shrubs, a few sweet herbs, and so nursed the little
spot into a miniature garden. Miss Hallet herself was seated just within the
open door of the dwelling, darning a rent in a pillow-case. The door opened
straight upon this room; a pretty parlour, very well furnished. The kitchen was
behind; and two good bedchambers and a smaller room were above. Not a large
house, thinks the reader. No: but it was regarded as large by the poorer
dwellers on the cliff, and Miss Hallet was looked up to by them as a lady.
Having a small but sufficient income, she lived quietly and peaceably, mixing
but little with other people.</p>
<p>Through family misfortunes she had been deprived of a home in early life, and
she took a situation, half companion, half lady's-maid. The lady she served
bequeathed her by will enough money to live upon. Miss Hallet had then saved
money of her own; she came to Greylands, her native place, bought the cottage on
the cliff, and settled herself in it. Her brother, like herself, had had to turn
to and support himself. He went to sea in the merchant service, passed in time
the examinations before the Board of Trade, and rose to command a vessel trading
to the coast of Spain. But he never got beyond that: and one stormy night the
unfortunate vessel sunk with himself and all hands. He left two orphan children,
a son and daughter, not provided for; Miss Hallet adopted them, and they came
home to her at Greylands. The boy, George, she sent to a good school at
Stilborough; he had to walk to and fro night and morning: Jane went to the Grey
Sisters. George took to the sea; in spite of all his aunt could say or do.
Perhaps the liking for it was innate, and he was always about in boats and on
the beach when at Greylands. He at length put himself on board Tom Dance's boat,
and said he would be a fisherman, and nothing else. In vain Miss Hallet pointed
out to him that he was superior to anything of the kind, and ought to look out
for a higher calling in life. George would not listen. Quitting his aunt's
roof--for he grew tired of the continual contentions she provoked--he went to
lodge in the village, and made apparently a good living. But the treacherous sea
took him, just as it had in like manner taken his father. One night during a
storm, a ship was sighted in distress: Tom Dance, who was as good-hearted as he
was reckless, put off in his boat with George Hallet to the rescue, and George
never came back again. Handsome, light-hearted, well-mannered George Hallet was
drowned. That was nearly two years ago. He was just twenty years of age; and was
said to have already been given a share in Tom Dance's earnings. Tom Dance owned
his own substantial boat; and his hauls of fish were good; no doubt profitable
also, for he was always flush of money. His son, a silent kind of young man, was
his partner now, and went out in the boat with him as George Hallet used to do.
They lived in one of the cottages on the beach. Old Mrs. Dance, Tom's mother,
had her dwelling in a solitary place underneath the perpendicular cliff: not on
the village side of it, as the other dwellings were, but facing the sea. It was
a lonely spot, inaccessible at times when the tides were high. Tom Dance, who
was generous to his mother, and kept her well, would have had her quit it for a
more sociably situated habitation: but the old woman was attached to her
many-years homestead, and would not listen to him. When we have grown old in a
home, we like it better than any other, no matter what may be its drawbacks.</p>
<p>Miss Hallet finished the darn, and turned the pillow-case about to look for
another. She was a tall, fair, angular lady of fifty, with a cold, hard
countenance; three or four prim flat curls of grey hair peeped out on her
forehead from beneath her cap; tortoiseshell spectacles were stretched across
her well-shaped nose. She had a fawn-coloured woollen shawl crossed about her
for warmth--for, though a nice spring day, it was hardly the weather yet for one
of her age to sit exposed to the open air.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, this must have been cut!&quot;</p>
<p>The spectacles had rested upon an almost imperceptible fray, whose edges were
so keen and close as to impart a suspicion that it had never come by natural
wear and tear. Miss Hallet drew in her thin lips grimly.</p>
<p>&quot;And since the wash too!&quot; she continued, when the gaze was over. &quot;Jane must
know something of this: she helped the woman to fold. Jane is frightfully
heedless.&quot;</p>
<p>Threading a fresh needleful of the soft, fine darning cotton, she was
applying herself to repair the damage, when footsteps were heard ascending the
narrow zigzag path. Another minute, and Tom Dance's son loomed into view; a
short, sturdy, well-meaning, but shy and silent youth of twenty.</p>
<p>&quot;Father's duty, Miss Hallet, and he has sent up this fish, if you'd be
pleased to accept him,&quot; said the young man, showing a good-sized fish with large
scales, resting on a wicker-tray. Miss Hallet was charmed. Her hard face relaxed
into as much of a smile as it could relax.</p>
<p>&quot;Dear me, what a beautiful fish! How good your father is, Wally! Always
thinking of somebody! Give him my best thanks back again. You have just got in,
I suppose?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just ten minutes ago,&quot; responded Wally. &quot;Been out two tides.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I wonder your father does not begin to think more of his ease--and so
well off as he must be! The night seems the same to him for work as the day.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;One catches the best fish under the moon,&quot; shortly remarked the young man,
as he handed over the wicker-tray.</p>
<p>Miss Hallet took it into the house, and brought it back to him without the
fish. Mr. Walter Dance caught the tray with a silent nod, and sped down the
steep path at a rate, that, to unaccustomed eyes, might have seemed to put his
neck in peril.</p>
<p>Barely had Miss Hallet taken up her sewing again, when another visitor
appeared. This one's footsteps were lighter and softer than the young man's, and
she was seen almost as soon as heard. A dark-haired, quick-speaking young woman
in black. It was Harriet, waiting-maid to Mrs. Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;Is your niece at home, Miss Hallet?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No. She's gone to Stilborough. How are you, Harriet?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I'm all right, thank you. What a cliff this is to climb up!--a'most
takes one's breath away. Gone to Stilborough, is she? Well, that's a bother!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What did you want with her?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Has she done any of them han'kerchers, do you know?&quot; returned the young
woman, without replying to the direct question.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't say. I know she has begun them. Would you like to come in and sit
down?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I've no time for sitting down. My missis has sent me off here on the spur of
the moment: and when she sends one out on an errand for herself one had best not
linger, you know. Besides, I must get back to dress my ladies.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, must you,&quot; indifferently remarked Miss Hallet; who rarely evinced
curiosity as to her neighbours' doings, or encouraged gossip upon trifles.</p>
<p>&quot;They are all going off to a dinner party at Stilborough; and missis took it
into her head just now that she'd use one of her new fine cambric han'kerchers,&quot;
continued Harriet. &quot;So she sent me off here to get one.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But Mrs. Castlemaine is surely not short of fine handkerchiefs!&quot; cried Miss
Hallet.</p>
<p>&quot;Short of fine han'kerchers!--why, she's got a drawer fall. It was just a
freak for a new thing; that's all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I do not know whether one is done, Harriet. Jane has been working at
one; she was at it last night; but I did not notice whether she finished it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can't you look, please, Miss Hallet?&quot;</p>
<p>Miss Hallet rose from her chair and went upstairs. She came back
empty-handed.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't see the handkerchiefs anywhere in Jane's room, Harriet. I daresay
she has locked them up in her work-drawer: she has taken to lock up the drawer
lately, I've noticed. If you could wait a few minutes she might be in: she'll
not be long now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I can't wait; they start off at five,&quot; was the girl's answer: &quot;and the
missis and Miss Ethel have both got to be dressed. So I'll say good afternoon,
ma'am.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good afternoon,&quot; repeated Miss Hallet. &quot;Should Jane return in time, if she
happens to have finished one of the handkerchiefs, she shall bring it up.&quot;</p>
<p>The young woman turned away with a brisk step, but not at the speed Walter
Dance had used. By-and-by, quite an hour later, Jane Hallet came in.</p>
<p>A slender, ladylike, nice-looking girl of nineteen; with a fair, soft, gentle
face, mild blue eyes, hair light and bright, and almost child-like features.
Jane's good looks, of which she was no doubt conscious, and Jane's propensity to
dress too much were a source of continual vexation to Miss Hallet: so to say, a
stumbling-block in her path. Jane wore a dark blue merino dress, a very pretty
grey cloak, with a hood and tassels, and a straw bonnet trimmed with blue. Miss
Hallet groaned.</p>
<p>&quot;And you must walk off in all those best things to-day, Jane! Just to go to
the wool shop at Stilborough! I wonder what will become of you!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was so fine a day, aunt,&quot; came the cheerful, apologetic answer. &quot;I have
not hurt them.</p>
<p>&quot;You've not done them good. Are any of those handkerchiefs of Mrs.
Castlemaine's finished?&quot; resumed the aunt, after a pause.</p>
<p>&quot;One is.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then you must go up at once with it to Greylands' Rest. Don't take your
cloak off--unless, indeed, you'd like to change it for your old one which would
be the right thing to do,&quot; added Miss Hallet, snappishly. &quot;And your bonnet,
too!&quot;</p>
<p>Jane stood still for a moment, and something like a cloud passed over her
face. She did not particularly care to go to Greylands' Rest.</p>
<p>&quot;I am tired with my walk, aunt.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That can't be helped: you must take the handkerchief all the same,&quot; said
Miss Hallet. And she explained the reason, and that she had promised to send one
if it were done.</p>
<p>&quot;You will be in time, Jane: it is hardly half-past four. The maid said the
family were to start at five.&quot;</p>
<p>Jane went up to her chamber; a room that she took care to make look as pretty
as she could. A chest of drawers stood by the bed. Taking a key from her pocket,
she opened the top long drawer, the only one that was locked, and lifted out the
paper of handkerchiefs. Half-a-dozen handkerchiefs of the finest and softest
cambric, almost like a spider's web, that Mrs. Castlemaine had given to her to
hem-stitch.</p>
<p>Any little job of this kind Jane Hallet was glad to undertake. The money
helped to buy her clothes. Otherwise she was entirely dependent upon her aunt.
The Grey Ladies had taught her all kinds of fine needlework. When she had none
of that to do--and she did not have it often--she filled up her leisure time in
knitting lambs' wool socks for a shop at Stilborough. There was no necessity for
her to do this, and Miss Hallet did not cordially approve of it; but it gave
Jane a feeling of independency.</p>
<p>Snatching a moment to look into the glass and put her hair in order, Jane
went down with the handkerchief, neatly folded in thin white paper. All the
girls instincts were nice: she was in fact too much of a lady for her position.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought you might be changing those smart things for your everyday ones,&quot;
crossly spoke Miss Hallet, as Jane went through the sitting-room. &quot;Mrs.
Castlemaine wall look askance at your finery.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There was no time for it, aunt,&quot; replied Jane, a sudden blush dyeing her
face, as she hastened out.</p>
<p>She ran down the cliff, went past the Grey Nunnery, and so up Chapel
Lane--which was the back way to Greylands' Rest, and not the front. It was not
her wish or intention to see Mrs. Castlemaine, if she could avoid it; or any of
the family. Presenting herself at the back door, she asked for Harriet. One of
the other servants took her into a small parlour, and said she would tell the
lady's maid. Five o'clock had struck before Harriet bustled in.</p>
<p>&quot;The han'kercher, is it? Mrs. Castlemaine'll be glad. When she sets her mind
on a thing, she do set it. Come along, Jane Hallet, she wants to see you.&quot;</p>
<p>No opportunity was afforded to Jane of saying no, and she followed Harriet
along the passages. Mrs. Castlemaine, her rich black silk dinner dress covered
by a large warm shawl, stood in the hall. Ethel Reene, in black net and white
ribbons, and wearing her scarlet cloak, was also there. The carriage waited
outside. Jane went forward shrinkingly, her face turning pale and red
alternately.</p>
<p>&quot;I just want to see it before I take it,&quot; said Mrs. Castlemaine, holding out
her hand for the handkerchief. &quot;Is it tumbled much? Oh, I see; it is very nice,
quite smooth. How well you have kept it, Jane Hallet! Here, Harriet, I don't
want this one now.&quot;</p>
<p>She tossed back an embroidered handkerchief to the maid, and swept out to the
carriage. Ethel smiled at Jane, as she followed her stepmother.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sure it is very good of you, Jane, to come up with it for mamma,&quot; she
said, feeling in her sensitive heart that Mrs. Castlemaine had not given one
word of thanks to the girl.</p>
<p>Mr. Castlemaine came downstairs, an overcoat on his arm. He nodded kindly to
Jane as he passed, and inquired after Miss Hallet. Miles and Harriet stood in
the porch, watching the carriage away. Jane was a little behind, just within the
hall.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought Mr. Harry was going,&quot; observed Harriet. &quot;What has took him not to
go?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't know,&quot; said Miles. &quot;One never can be certain of Mr. Harry--whether he
goes to a place or whether he doesn't go.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps he has walked on,&quot; remarked Harriet carelessly, as she turned round.
&quot;I say, Jane Hallet, you'll stay and take a dish o' tea, now you are here. We
are just going to have it.&quot;</p>
<p>But Jane hastily declined. No persuasion, apparently, would induce her to
accept the invitation; and she departed at once. Half an hour later Madame Guise
and her pupil came home: they had been out for a long walk.</p>
<p>&quot;Have they all gone?&quot; inquired Madame of one of the housemaids.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, dear, yes, ma'am. Half an hour ago.&quot;</p>
<p>Now, this answer deceived Charlotte Guise. She knew the dinner engagement had
been accepted by Mr. and Mrs. Castlemaine, their son, and Ethel. She had no
thought or idea but what they could collectively keep it: and in saying to the
servant &quot;Have they all gone,&quot; she comprised the four, and understood that she
was answered accordingly.</p>
<p>She and Flora took tea together. The child was growing somewhat more
tractable than she used to be. Not much as yet; it was just a little shade of
improvement. Flora was always better when her mamma was away; and Madame Guise
had no trouble with her on this night. She even went to bed at the appointed
hour, eight o'clock, without rebellion, after a regalement of what she was
particularly fond of--bread and jam.</p>
<p>&quot;I will take a slice of this bread and butter and jam also,&quot; remarked Madame
to Miles; &quot;and then I shall not trouble you to bring in supper for me. It will
be a nice change. We like this confiture much in my country.&quot;</p>
<p>So Madame took her light supper that evening with Flora, and afterwards wrote
a letter. At nine o'clock she rang the bell to say she was going up to her room
for the night, feeling tired, and should require nothing more. Miles, who had
answered the bell, saw her go up with her candle. He put out the sitting-room
lights for safety, and went back to the kitchen. His master and mistress were
not expected home before hall-past eleven.</p>
<p>In her room stood Charlotte Guise, white as a sheet. She was contemplating a
deed that night, from which, in spite of what she deemed her justification for
it, she shrank in horror. It was no less a step than the opening with a false
key the private bureau of Mr. Castlemaine.</p>
<p>Some little time the best part of a fortnight, had elapsed since that walk of
hers to Stilborough and Marie had had the measles--&quot;very kindly,&quot; as Mr. Parker
and the Grey Sisters expressed it--and was well again. Telling a plausible story
of the loss of her keys to a Stilborough locksmith that day, Madame had obtained
from him--a key that would undo, if necessary, half the locks in Mr.
Castlemaine's house. No opportunity had presented itself for using it until now.
Such an occasion as this, when the house was deserted by all, save the servants,
might not speedily occur again.</p>
<p>She stood in her chamber, trembling and nervous, the light from the candle
reflected on her face. The staircase clock struck the quarter past nine, and her
heart beat faster as she heard it. It was the signal she had been waiting for.</p>
<p>For the servants would now be settled at their supper, and were not likely
soon to get up from it. Nine o'clock was the nominal hour for the meal: but, as
she chanced to know, they rarely sat down to it much before a quarter past. With
the house free and nothing to do, they would not hurry themselves over it
to-night. Half an hour--nay, an hour, she knew she might freely reckon upon
while they were shut up at table in the comfortable kitchen, talking and eating.</p>
<p>Charlotte Guise opened the door and stood to listen. Not a sound save the
ticking of the clock broke the stillness. She was quite alone. Flora was fast
asleep in her room in the front corridor, next to Mrs. Castlemaine's chamber,
for she had been in to see, and she had taken the precaution of turning the key
on the child for safety: it would not do to be interrupted by her. Yet another
minute she stood listening, candle in hand. Then, swiftly crossing the corridor,
she stole into the study through the double doors. A fear had been upon her that
she might find the second door a stumbling block, as Mr. Castlemaine sometimes
locked it when he went abroad. It was open to-night, and she whisked through it.</p>
<p>The same orderly, unlittered room that she had seen before. No papers lay
about, no deeds were left out that could be of use to her. Three books were
stacked upon the side table; a newspaper lay on a chair; and that was positively
all. The fire had long ago gone out; on the mantelpiece was a box of matches.</p>
<p>Putting down the candle, Charlotte Guise took out her key, and tried the
bureau. It opened at once. She swung back the heavy lid and waited a moment to
recover herself: her lips were white, her breath came in gasps. Oh, apart from
the baseness, the dishonour of the act, which was very present to her mind, what
if she were to be caught at it?</p>
<p>Papers were there en masse. The drawers and pigeon-holes seemed to be full of
them. So far as she could judge from a short examination--and she did not dare
to give a long one--these papers had reference to business transactions, to
sales of goods and commercial matters--which she rather wondered at, but did not
understand. But of deeds she could see none.</p>
<p>What did Charlotte Guise expect to find? What did she promise herself by this
secret search? In truth, she could not have told. She wanted to get some record
of her husband's fate, some proof that should compromise the Master of
Greylands. She would also have been glad to find some will, or deed of gift,
that should show to her how Greyland's Rest had been really left by old Anthony
Castlemaine: whether to his son Basil or to James. If to Basil, why there would
be a proof--as she, poor thing, deemed it--of the manner in which James
Castlemaine had dealt with his nephew, and its urging motive.</p>
<p>No, there was nothing. Opening this bundle of papers, rapidly glancing into
that, turning over the other, she could find absolutely nothing to help her: and
in the revulsion of feeling which the disappointment caused, she said to herself
how worse than foolish she had been to expect to find anything: how utterly
devoid of reason she must be, to suppose Mr. Castlemaine would preserve mementos
of an affair so dangerous. And where he kept his law papers, or parchments
relating to his estate, she could not tell, but certainly they were not in the
bureau, unless there were secret receptacles to which she knew not how to
penetrate.</p>
<p>Not daring to stay longer, for near upon half an hour must have elapsed, she
replaced the things as she had found them, so far as she could remember. All was
done save one drawer; a small drawer, at the foot, next the slab. It had but a
few receipted bills in it: there was one from a saddler, one from a coach maker,
and such like. The drawer was very shallow; and, in closing it, the bills were
forced out again. Charlotte Guise, in her trepidation and hurry, pulled the
drawer forwards too forcibly, and pulled it out of its frame.</p>
<p>Had it chanced by accident--this little contretemps? Ah, no. When do these
strange trifles pregnant with events of moment, occur by chance? At the top of
the drawer, itself <i>in</i> the drawer, appeared a narrow, closed compartment,
opening with a slide. Charlotte drew the slide back, and saw within it a folded
letter and some small article wrapped in paper.</p>
<p>The letter, which she opened and read, proved to be the one written by Basil
Castlemaine on his death-bed--the same letter that had been brought over by
young Anthony, and given to his uncle. There was nothing much to note in
it--save that Basil assumed throughout it that the estate was his, and would be
his son's after him. Folding it again, she opened the bit of paper: and there
shone out a diamond ring that flashed in the candle's rays.</p>
<p>Charlotte Guise took it up and let it fall again. Let it fall in a kind of
sick horror, and staggered to a chair and sat down half fainting. For it was her
husband's ring.</p>
<p>The ring that Anthony had worn always on his left-hand little finger: the
ring that he had on when he quitted Gap. It was the same ring that John Bent and
his wife had often noticed and admired; the ring that was undoubtedly on his
hand when he followed Mr. Castlemaine that ill-fated night into the Friar's
Keep. His poor wife recognized it instantly: she knew it by its peculiar
setting.</p>
<p>To her mind it was proof indisputable that he had indeed been put out out of
the way for ever. Mr. Castlemaine must have possessed himself of the ring,
unwilling that so valuable a jewel should be lost: perhaps had drawn it from
Anthony's finger after death. She shuddered at the thought. But, in the midst of
her distress, reason told her that this was only a negative proof, after all;
not sufficient for her to act upon, to charge Mr. Castlemaine with the murder.</p>
<p>When somewhat recovered, she kissed the ring, and put it back into the small
compartment with the letter. Pushing in the slide, she shut the drawer, and
closed and locked the bureau; thus leaving all things as she had found them. Not
very much result had been gained, it is true, but enough to spur her onwards on
her future search. With her mind in a chaos of tumult,--with her brain in a
whirl of pain,--with every vein throbbing and fevered, she left the candle on
the ground where she had now lodged it, and went to the window, gasping for air.</p>
<p>The night was bright with stars; opposite to her, and seemingly at no
distance at all, rose that dark building, the Friar's Keep. As she stood with
her eyes strained upon it, though in reality not seeing it, but deep in inward
thought, there suddenly shone a faint light at one of its casements. Her
attention was awakened now; her heart began to throb.</p>
<p>The faint light grew brighter: and she distinctly saw a form in a monk's
habit, the cowl drawn over his head, slowly pass the window; the light seeming
to come from a lamp in his outstretched hand. All the superstitions tales she
had heard of the place rushed into her mind: this must be the apparition of the
Grey Friar. Charlotte Guise had an awful dread of revenants, and she turned sick
and faint.</p>
<p>With a cry, only half suppressed, bursting from her parted lips, she caught
up the candle, afraid to stay, and flew through the door into the narrow
passage. The outer door was opening to her hand, when the voice of Harry
Castlemaine was heard in the corridor, almost close to the door.</p>
<p>Ah, far more sick and faint did she turn now! Discovery seemed inevitable.
Instinct led her to blow out the light and to push the door as close as she
could push it. She dared not shut it: he might have heard the click of the
latch. Had the others come home? Was Mr. Castlemaine ascending to his study to
catch her there? Trembling, shaking, panting, the unhappy lady stood in this
acme of terror, the ghost of the Friar's Keep behind her, the dread of detection
before her. And the candle was making a dreadful smell!</p>
<p>That alone might betray her: Harry Castlemaine might push back the door to
ascertain where the smell came from. Could the floor have opened and disclosed a
yawning pit, the unhappy lady would thankfully have disappeared within it.</p>
<p>The minute seemed like an hour. Harry did not come on. He appeared to have
halted close by to listen to something. Miles was speaking below.</p>
<p>&quot;Thought I had gone with them to the dinner, and so put out the lights!&quot;
retorted Harry, in his, free, clear, good-natured tones. &quot;You saw the carriage
drive away, I suppose, without me. Well, light up again, and bring in some
supper.&quot;</p>
<p>He came on now, and went into his chamber at the end of the corridor. Staying
there a minute or two, as though changing his coat, he passed back, and down
stairs again. Charlotte Guise, shaking, in every limb, stole out as the echo of
his footsteps died away, closed the door and took refuge in her own room. There
she went into hysterics: hysterics that she was totally unable to suppress, and
muffled her head in a blanket to deaden the cry.</p>
<p>The next morning there was commotion in the house: Miss Flora Castlemaine had
found herself locked in her bedroom. Given to take impromptu excursions in a
morning en robe de nuit, after books, or the kitten, or into somebody's bedroom
who was sure not to want her, the young lady for once found herself caged. Mrs.
Castlemaine made an angry stir about it; locked doors were so dangerous in case
of fire, she said. She accused the maid, Eliza, who attended on Miss Flora, and
threatened her with dismissal.</p>
<p>&quot;I can be upon my Bible oath that I never locked the door,&quot; cried the girl.
&quot;Why should I wish to lock it last night, more than any other night? I never
touched the key. For the matter of that, I could not tell whether the key was
outside or inside. You may send me away this hour, ma'am, but I am innocent, and
I can't say more than that.&quot;</p>
<p>Poor Madame Guise, who was complaining of migrane this morning, and whose
eyes were red and heavy, took the blame upon herself, to exculpate the
wrongfully accused servant. In her terror of the previous night, she had totally
forgotten to unlock Flora's door. She hastened now to say that she had looked in
on the sleeping child when she herself went to bed: in coming out, it was
possible she had turned the key. Many of the chamber doors in France shut and
opened with the key only, she might have turned the key unthinkingly, meaning
but to shut the door.</p>
<p>So the matter ended. But Charlotte Guise could not help feeling how painfully
one deceit one wrong act, leads to another. And Mr. Harry, she found, had never
been to the dinner at all. Some matter of business, or perhaps some whim, had
led him to break his engagement, and to give due notice of it the day beforehand
to the entertainers. As Miles had observed, one never could be certain of Harry
Castlemaine.</p>

<h4><a name="div1_18" href="#div1Ref_18">CHAPTER XVIII.</a></h4>
<h5>THE GREY MONK.</h5>
<br>

<p>That the Grey Monk was haunting the Friar's Keep that night, and for a longer
period than could be quite agreeable to any chance passer-by, appeared to be
indisputable.</p>
<p>Some of the Grey Sisters were up that evening at the coastguard station. The
wife of one of the men was very ill, her infant being only three days old: and
Sister Rachel had been with her for the day. At eight o'clock Sister Rachel was
relieved by Sister Mona, who would remain for the night. Sister Ann walked up
from the Nunnery with Sister Mona for company, and would walk back again with
Sister Rachel.</p>
<p>It was about half past eight that they left the station to return home, the
Sisters Ann and Rachel. The night was starlight, the air somewhat frosty.
Talking of the poor woman, just quitted, Sister Rachel saying the fever was
getting higher, they approached the Friar's Keep. They were on the opposite side
of the road, and had nearly reached Chapel Lane when something strange--some
kind of glimmer or faint flash--struck on Sister Rachel's vision, and caused her
to turn her eyes on the upper casements of the Keep. With a spring and a cry,
she seized hold of Sister Ann and clung to her.</p>
<p>&quot;Have you trod upon a stone?&quot; asked practical Sister Ann. But the very fact
of turning to her companion, who was outside, brought the windows of the Keep
before her, and she saw the Grey Monk slowly gliding along, with his cowl
covering his head, and his lamp in his hand. A shadowy kind of form, suggestive
of terrible ideas that don't pertain to earth.</p>
<p>The blood of the two unfortunate Sisters seemed to turn; they nearly sank
away in evaporation. They clung to each other, arm in arm, hand to hand,
pushing, staggering, pressing onwards, and in a minute, as it seemed, gained the
Grey Nunnery. The door was opened by Sister Caroline, and they burst into the
reception parlour.</p>
<p>The Superior sat there, Mary Ursula; and most of the sisters with her who
were not out on charitable missions. To have stopped the tongues of the two
terrified grey women would have been about as feasible as to stem a rushing
torrent in its overwhelming coarse. They had seen the apparition of the Grey
Monk gliding past the window with their own eyes; had seen his lamp; had nearly
fainted at him altogether.</p>
<p>&quot;Tut, tut, tut!&quot; reproved Sister Mildred, who was better this evening and
down stairs. &quot;I think you must have been deceived by your fears. <i>I</i> never
saw it in my life.&quot;</p>
<p>But they only told their tale the more persistently, and Sister Mildred
wavered. In vain Mary Ursula represented to them that there were no such things
as ghosts: that people in believing in them, were misled by their fears and
fancies. To this the two scared women only reiterated that they saw. They were
walking quietly along, talking of the poor sick wife of the coastguardsman;
nothing could have been further from their thoughts than any fears or fancies,
when the figure suddenly appeared, plainly and unmistakably, before their
astonished eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Sister Rachel saw it first,&quot; urged Sister Ann, anxious to defend herself
against the imputation of having taken alarm unnecessarily, as though she were a
foolish, timid child. &quot;When she called out and caught hold of my arm, I thought
she had trod upon a stone, or twisted her foot, or something; and, in turning to
her there I saw the pale light in the window, and the figure of the Grey Monk.
We stood rooted to the spot, holding on to one another, just too frightened to
move, our poor eyes staring at the Keep. He glided past that window, and then
past the other, his lighted lamp stretched out in his hand; just as Sister
Lettice once saw him glide a year or so ago--and she knows it.&quot;</p>
<p>Sister Lattice, a simple woman, great in pudding-making, who had stood
listening with round, frightened eyes, murmured her confirmation. One night,
when she was belated, having been to a farm-house where sickness reigned, she
had seen it exactly as the two sisters were describing it now; and had come home
and fainted.</p>
<p>&quot;I was beginning to forget my fright,&quot; said Sister Lettice, looking
pleadingly at the two Superiors. &quot;But since the late talk there has been about
that poor Mr. Anthony Castlemaine, I've not dared to go out of doors at night
alone. For the ghost has been seen more frequently since he disappeared: in
fact, as the ladies know, it's said by some that it is the young man's spirit
that comes now, not the Grey Friar's.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was the Grey Friar we saw to-night, let people say what they will,&quot;
rejoined Sister Ann.</p>
<p>The talking continued. This was a great event in the monotonous existence of
the Grey ladies: and the two unfortunate Sisters were shaking still. Mary Ursula
withdrew quietly from the room, and put on the grey cloak and bonnet of the
order, and came down again, and let herself out at the front door.</p>
<p>There was something in all this gossip that disturbed and distressed Mary
Ursula. Anthony's fate and the uncertainty connected with it, was more often in
her mind than she would have cared to tell. Like Charlotte Guise, she--what with
dwelling on it and listening to the superstitions surmises in Greylands--had
grown to think that the Friar's Keep did contain some mystery not yet unsolved.
As to &quot;ghosts,&quot; Mary Castlemaine's sound good sense utterly repudiated all
belief in such. What, then, she naturally asked herself, was this figure, that
took the appearance of the traditional Grey Monk, and showed itself at the
windows of the Keep, lamp in hand? Had it anything to do with the disappearance
of Anthony?</p>
<p>Obeying an irresistible impulse, she was going forth to-night to look at this
said apparition herself--if, indeed, it would appear again and so allow itself
to be looked at. It was perhaps a foolish thing to do; but she wanted to see
with her own unprejudiced eyes what and whom it was like. With her whole heart
she wished the occurrences of that past February night and the mysteries of the
Friar's Keep--did it in truth contain any--were thrown open to the light of day:
it might tend to clear what was dark--to clear her uncle from the silent
suspicions attaching to him. It was of course his place to institute this
search, but he did not do it. Encasing himself in his pride, his haughty
indifference, Mary supposed he was content to let the matter alone until it
righted itself. But she loved her uncle and was painfully jealous for his good
name.</p>
<p>Turning swiftly out of the gate of the Nunnery, she went up the hill, passed
the Chapel Ruins, crossed the road, and stood still to gaze at the Friars' Keep.
The church clock was striking nine. Taking up her position under the hedge, in
almost the selfsame spot where John Bent and Anthony Castlemaine had taken
theirs that unlucky night, she fixed her eyes on the windows, and waited. The
old building, partly in ruins, looked grey and grim enough. Sometimes the moon
lighted it up; but there was no moon to night. The stars were bright, the
atmosphere was clear.</p>
<p>The minutes, as they went by, seemed like hours. Mary Ursula had not much
more patience than other people, and it was exhausting itself rapidly. Not a
shadow of a sign was there of the Grey Monk or of any other appearance. To judge
by its silence and its lonely look, one might have said the Keep had not been
entered since the Grey Monk was alive.</p>
<p>&quot;It is hardly to be supposed it would show itself twice in one night,&quot;
breathed Mary, in a spirit that was somewhat of a mocking one. But in that she
was mistaken: and she went away too soon.</p>
<p>At the end of a quarter of an hour--which had seemed to her like two
quarters--she gave it up. Crossing the road to the chapel gate, she went in,
traversed the ruins to the opposite corner to the Friar's Keep, and stood
looking out to sea. Mary had another vexation on her mind that night: earlier in
the day a report had reached her in a letter that her recreant lover, William
Blake-Gordon, was engaged again: So soon!--so soon! Whether it was true, she
knew not: it could not, either way, make much difference to the pain that filled
her heart: but the report wrung it cruelly. The other name, mentioned in
connection with his, was Agatha Mountsorrel's; her own close friend of former
days. She knew that she ought not to feel this bitter pain, this wild jealousy;
that, once he was lost to her, she should have put him out of her mind for good.
Ah, it is all very well for the wise to lay down laws, to say this is wrong and
the other is right and you must act accordingly! human nature is but frail, and
the heart must be true to itself.</p>
<p>Some slight movement caught her attention below. It was low water, and the
strip of beach underneath was free. Mary leaned over to look. But she could not
see: the shelving-out rocks hid the path as she stood. In the deep silence of
the night, she thought she could distinguish whispering voices, and she waited
until their owners should have passed a little farther on, where a bend inward
of the rocks allowed a view to be obtained.</p>
<p>It brought the greatest vexation of all! A tall fine form came into sight too
tall, too fine, to be any but Harry Castlemaine's. His arm was around the waist
of some young girl; his head was turned to her, and they were conversing
eagerly. She wore a dark cloak, its hood drawn up over her head: Mary could not
see her face, for their backs were towards her, but she fancied it was Jane
Hallet. They passed away under the Nunnery, as if returning to the village, and
were lost to sight and hearing. Only at quite low water was that narrow strip
passable.</p>
<p>The heaving sea stretched itself out before her eyes; the dead of the past
ages were mouldering away beneath her feet; the canopy of sky, studded with
stars in its vast expanse, lay above her head. But for all these signs, and the
thoughts they involved, Mary Ursula Castlemaine might in that moment have lost
heart and courage. The by-ways of life seemed very crooked just then; its
troubles pregnant with perplexity and pain. But God was over all. The turbulent
waves were held in check by His Hand; the long-ago dead had been called by Him;
the sky and the stars were but emblems of His power. Yes, He was over all. From
His throne in Heaven He looked down on the world; on its cares, its trials, its
weaknesses, its temptations and sins; overruling all according to His will. He
could set things straight; He was full of compassion, long-suffering, and mercy.
The dark troubles here would be merged in a bright hereafter: in a place where
there should be no cankering heart-break, where sorrow and suffering should flee
away. A few more years, and----</p>
<p>&quot;Dear me, ma'am! I beg your pardon.&quot;</p>
<p>Mary Ursula, buried in her far-off thoughts in the solitary place, was
startled at the address, and turned round with a slight cry. Close at her elbow
stood John Bent; a small basket in his band, covered with a white cloth.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sure I frightened you, ma'am!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just for the moment you did,&quot; she said, with her sweet smile, interrupting
his farther apologies. &quot;I was standing to take a look at the sea. How grand it
is from this spot!&quot;</p>
<p>John Bent agreed that it was grand, and proceeded to explain his presence.
His wife had dispatched him with some broth and other trifles that might be
acceptable to the sick woman up at the coastguard station. In passing the chapel
ruins on his way thither, he had caught sight of some one standing at the edge
of the cliff, and turned in at once to see who it was. &quot;No wonder you did not
hear me, ma'am, for I crept up on tiptoe,&quot; he acknowledged. &quot;Since the
disappearance of Mr. Anthony Castlemaine, this place is just as though it
haunted me, for it is never out of my mind. To see somebody standing here in the
shade of the corner wall gave me a turn. I could not imagine who it was, and
meant to pounce upon 'em.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The place lies on my mind also,&quot; said Mary Ursula. &quot;I wish the doings of
that night could be brought to light.&quot;</p>
<p>The landlord shook his head, she could not wish it as he wished it.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think now it ever will be,&quot; he said. &quot;At least, I often fear it will
not. There is only one person, as I believe, who could throw light upon it; and
it does not seem to be his pleasure to speak.&quot;</p>
<p>She knew that he alluded to her uncle; and she seized on the moment for
speaking a few words that she had long wished to speak to John Bent. In spite of
the opinion he held, and that she knew he held, in regard to that past night,
she respected the man greatly: she remembered how much her father had respected
him.</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot be ignorant, Mr. Bent, of the stigma you would cast on Mr.
Castlemaine: the suspicion, I would rather say, lying in your mind against him.
I believe that nothing can be more unjust: nothing more inconsistent with the
true facts, could they be disclosed.&quot;</p>
<p>John Bent was silent. She stood close in the corner, within the shade cast by
the slanting bit of stone wall, the blank side wall of the Grey Nunnery towering
close above her. John was so near as almost to touch her. The sea was before
them, a light twinkling on it here and there in the distance from some fishing
vessel; the grass-grown square, once the site of the chapel, with its dottings
of low crumbling walls, lay to their left, and beyond it was the Friars' Keep,
its gothic door pushed to as usual. A lonely spot altogether it was to stand in,
in the silence of the spring night.</p>
<p>&quot;Why should you cherish this suspicion?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p>John Bent tilted his hat slightly up on one side, and slowly rubbed his head.
He was a very honest-minded, straightforward man; and though he might on
occasion find it inexpedient to avow the truth, he yet would not, even by
implication, speak an untruth; or tacitly let one be inferred.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a subject, ma'am, on which my mouth ought to be closed to you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not at all,&quot; she answered. &quot;Were I Mr. Castlemaine's wife or daughter you
might urge that. I am his niece, it is true; but I have now in a manner
withdrawn myself from the world, and----But I will leave that argument and go to
another. For my own sake, I wish you to speak openly with me. These troubles lie
on my mind; sometimes I cannot sleep for thinking of them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am sure I cannot sleep for them,&quot; said John.</p>
<p>&quot;And I think that steps should be taken to put the doubts to flight--if we
only knew what steps they could be.&quot;</p>
<p>John stooped to lodge the basket on the low top of the grass-grown cliff,
jutting upwards before him. But he did not answer.</p>
<p>&quot;Believe me when I say that no thought of reproach on you for entertaining
these opinions rests on my mind,&quot; proceeded Miss Castlemaine. &quot;I am sure that
you conscientiously hold them; that you cannot divest yourself of them; and----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wish I didn't,&quot; interposed John. &quot;I only wish I had no cause to.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There is no cause,&quot; she said in a low tone; &quot;no true one. I am as sure of it
as that I stand here. Even had it been Mr. Castlemaine whom you saw come in here
that night, I feel sure his presence could have been explained away. But I think
you must have been mistaken. You have no confirmation that it was he: nay, the
confirmation lies rather the other way--that he was not here. Considering all
this, I think you ought not to persist in your opinion, Mr. Bent; or to let the
world believe you persist in it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As I have said before, madam, this is a matter that I don't care to talk to
you upon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I wish you to talk to me. I ask you to talk to me. You may see that I
speak to you confidentially--do you so speak to me. There is no one else I would
thus talk with about it, save you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Madam, it's just this--not but what I feel the honour you do me, and thank
you for it; and goodness knows what honour I hold and have always held you in,
Miss Castlemaine--But it's this, ma'am: your opinion lies one way and mine the
other: and while I would not insist to <i>you</i> that Mr. Castlemaine was
guilty, I yet can't let myself say he was not.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am as fully persuaded he was not as that those stars are above us,&quot; she
said. But John made no reply.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Anthony was made away with, madam. I----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, no,&quot; she interrupted with a shiver.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't accuse Mr. Castlemaine of having done it,&quot; proceeded John. &quot;What I
say, and hold to, is this, ma'am: that Mr. Castlemaine must know something of
what became of him. But he does not avow it; he keeps silence: and it is that
silence that strengthens the suspicions against him. I saw him come in here that
night just as surely as I see you here now, Miss Castlemaine. It's true I did
not see him so clearly go into the Friar's Keep; these mouldering walls,
sticking up here and there a foot or two from the earth, dodge one's eyesight:
still I saw the shade of him, like, go in: and in less than a minute my
attention was called off Mr. Castlemaine by Mr. Anthony's own movements. I saw
<i>him</i> go into the Keep: he made for it straight.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I say that the person you saw may not have been Mr. Castlemaine,&quot; she
urged again, after having quietly heard him to the end.</p>
<p>&quot;What other man is there in Greylands, ma'am, of the height and bearing of
Mr. Castlemaine--one with the bold, free, upright walk and the gentleman's
dress?&quot; returned the landlord. &quot;Only Mr. Harry: and Mr. Harry is too young and
slender to be mistaken for his father even in the moonlight. Mr. Harry happened
to be away that night at Newerton.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think you are cruelly, persistently obstinate. Forgive me, Mr. Bent; I do
not wish or intend to hurt your feelings,&quot; she added in a gentle, even kind
tone. &quot;It seems to me that you must have some animus against Mr. Castlemaine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The poor young gentleman was living under my roof, madam. I went forth with
him that night, halted with him opposite this very gate, and watched him in. It
has sat on my mind always since that I am in a manner accountable for him--that
it lies with me to find out what became of him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can understand the feeling and appreciate it,&quot; she answered quickly. &quot;In
itself it is a good and right feeling; but I think that it's very intensity
tends to mislead you, and to cause this very animosity against Mr. Castlemaine.
The person you saw come in here may have been a stranger: you have had no
confirmation of any kind that it was Mr. Castlemaine: and the eyesight at night
is so deceptive.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes I have,&quot; said John, dropping his voice to a whisper, and speaking with
evident reluctance. &quot;I have had confirmation. Madam, you make me speak against
my better will.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You allude to Anthony,&quot; she rejoined somewhat impatiently. &quot;You have said, I
know, that he likewise thought it was his uncle--as indeed seems proved by the
fact of his following him in. But, it may be that he was only led to think so by
some exclamation of yours; that he did not see it with his own eyes. He is not
here to prove it, one way or the other. In thus pressing my view of the case, I
am only anxious that the fair truth should be established,&quot; she resumed after an
instant's pause, as though she would explain her own persistency. &quot;I am not
wishing to mislead or bias you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We both saw him, ma'am, we both saw plainly that it was Mr. Castlemaine; but
I did not allude to Mr. Anthony,&quot; spoke John, in the same subdued tone. &quot;It has
been confirmed by another.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;By whom?&quot; she asked, drawing her cloak together with a sharp movement as
though she were cold. &quot;Do not hesitate; tell me all. I have said that I regard
this as a confidential interview.&quot;</p>
<p>And perhaps John Bent, after what had passed, could find no plea of refusal.
He was a very persuadable man when either his good sense or his good feeling was
appealed to. As Mrs. Bent was wont to tell him, he had a soft place in his
heart.</p>
<p>&quot;Up to last night that ever was, ma'am, I had no idea that Mr. Castlemaine
had been seen by any but us. But I find he was. I'll tell you what I've heard.
You will perhaps think the evidence not worth much, Miss Castlemaine, for the
man who saw him was three parts tipsy at the time: but he must have had his wits
about him, for all that.&quot;</p>
<p>To make clear to the reader what the landlord was about to relate we must go
back to the previous evening. On that evening at twilight, John Bent sauntered
over to the beach, and sat down on the bench to smoke his pipe. It was a fine,
still evening, favourable for the fishing-boats. While he was smoking peaceably,
and gazing at the stars, beginning to show themselves in the sky, Jack Tuff, the
sailor, strolled up, gave the landlord the good evening, and took his seat on
the same bench. He produced his pipe, evidently wanting to smoke; but he just as
evidently had no tobacco. John handed him some, and allowed him to light the
pipe by his own. Talking of this and that, they somehow got upon the subject of
Anthony Castlemaine's disappearance: and Mr. Tuff, perhaps out of gratitude for
the good tobacco, avowed to his astonished companion that he could have
confirmed his evidence, had he chosen, as to it having been Mr. Castlemaine who
had crossed the road to the chapel ruins that fatal February night.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Jack Tuff's account, his own movements that night had been
as follows. He had walked over to the little fishing hamlet, Beeton and taken a
glass with a comrade there. It might have been two glasses. At any rate, it was
enough to make Jack wish to pay another social visit as he went back to
Greylands, instead of going straight home. In one of the three cottages situate
at the back of Greylands' Rest, there lodged a sailor friend of Jack's: and
accordingly Jack turned up Chapel Lane--the nearest way from where he then
was--to make the call. There he stayed until late, taking other glasses, very
late indeed for the quiet village; and he turned out considerably after eleven
o'clock with unsteady legs. He staggered down Chapel Lane pretty safely until he
neared the other end of it. When opposite the turning to the Hutt, who should
emerge from that turning but some tall man. At the moment, Jack Tuff happened to
be holding on with one arm to a tree trunk, to steady himself: but he made it
out to be Mr. Castlemaine, and attempted to pull his old round hat off in token
of respect. He did not know whether Mr. Castlemaine saw him; but fancied he did
not see him. Mr. Castlemaine went up the lane towards his home, and Jack Tuff
went on down it.</p>
<p>So far, that might be regarded as a corroboration of the Master of Greylands'
statement at the time--namely, that he had left the Hutt about half-past eleven
after smoking a pipe with the Commodore: and the probability seemed to be that
Mr. Castlemaine had not seen Jack Tuff, or he might have called on him to
confirm his testimony as to the hour.</p>
<p>Jack Tuff continued his progress down the small remaining portion of the
lane, trying all the while to put on his hat: which he had succeeded in getting
off at last. Something was undoubtedly the matter with either the head or the
hat; for the hat would not go on the head, or the head into the hat. A branch of
a tree, or something, caught Jack's elbow, and the hat dropped; Jack, in
stooping for it, dropped also; and there he was, sitting amid the trunks of
trees on the side of the lane, his back propped against one of them and his hat
nowhere.</p>
<p>How long Jack remained there he did not pretend to say. His impression was
that he fell asleep; but whether that was so, or not, Jack could not have told
had he been bribed with a golden sovereign. At any rate, the next thing he heard
or remembered, was, that some steps were coming down the lane. Jack looked up,
and saw they were those of the Master of Greylands.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you sure it was him?&quot; interrupted John Bent, at this point of the
narration, edging a little bit nearer to Jack on the bench.</p>
<p>&quot;In course I'm sure,&quot; replied Jack Tuff. &quot;The moonlight shone full upon him
through the leafless branches of the trees, and I saw him plain. He didn't see
me that time, for sure. I was in the dark, back amid the clump o' trees; and he
went along with his head and eyes straight afore him to the end o' the lane.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And where did he go then?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't know. He didn't come back again. Suppose he was crossing over to the
Keep.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, go on,&quot; said John.</p>
<p>There was not much more to tell. After this incident, the passing of the
Master of Greylands, Mr. Tuff bethought himself that he might as well be getting
homewards. To make a start, however, was not easy of accomplishment. First he
had to find his hat, which took up some considerable tune: it was only when he
had given it up for lost that he became conscious it was doubled up under him as
he sat. Next he had to pull out his match-box and light his pipe: and that also
took time. Lastly he had to get upon his legs, a work requiring skill, but
accomplished by the friendly aid of the trees. Altogether from a quarter to half
an hour must have been used in the process. Once fairly started and clear of the
lane, he came upon Mr. Bent, pacing about opposite the ruins and waiting for Mr.
Anthony Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you hear the pistol-shot?&quot; asked John Bent when the recital was over.</p>
<p>&quot;Never heard it at all,&quot; said Jack Tuff. &quot;I must have been feeling for my
hat.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And why did you not say at the time that you saw the Master of
Greylands--and so have borne out my story?&quot; demanded John Bent as a final
question.</p>
<p>&quot;I dare say!&quot; retorted Jack Tuff: &quot;and he laughed at for an imbecile who was
drunk and saw double! Nobody 'ud believe me. I'm not a going to say it now, Mr.
Bent, except to you. I'm not a going to draw down Mr. Castlemaine upon me, and
perhaps get put away in gaol.&quot;</p>
<p>And this was all John Bent got from him. That the man spoke the strict truth
according to his belief--namely, that it was Mr. Castlemaine he saw both times
that night--John could have staked his life upon. But that the man was equally
determined not to say so much to the world, fearing the displeasure of Mr.
Castlemaine: nay, that he probably would deny it in toto if the world questioned
him, the landlord was equally sure of.</p>
<p>Miss Castlemaine heard the narrative in silence. It did not shake her belief
in the innocence of her uncle; but it made it more difficult to confute John
Bent, and she was now sorry to have spoken to him at all. With a deep sigh she
turned to depart.</p>
<p>&quot;We can only wait the elucidation that time will bring,&quot; she said to the
landlord. &quot;Rely upon it that if any ill deed was done that night, Mr.
Castlemaine had no hand in it.&quot;</p>
<p>John Bent maintained a respectful silence. They crossed the ruins, and he
held open the gate for her to pass through. Just then she remembered another
topic, and spoke of it.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it that appears at the casements here, in the guise of a Grey Friar?
Two of the Sisters have been alarmed by it to-night.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Something like a dozen people have been scared by it lately,&quot; said John. &quot;As
to what it is, ma'am, <i>I</i> don't know. Senseless idiots, to be frightened!
as if a ghost could harm us! I should like to see it appear to <i>me!</i>&quot;</p>
<p>With this answer, betraying not only his superiority to the Greylands world
in general, but his inward bravery, and a mutual goodnight, they parted. John
going up the hill with his basket; Miss Castlemaine turning towards the Nunnery,
and pondering deeply.</p>
<p>Strange, perhaps, to say, considering the state Jack Tuff was avowedly in
that eventful night, a conviction that his sight had not deceived him, had taken
hold of her. That some mystery did attach to that night, independent of the
disappearance of Anthony, she had always fancied: and this evidence only served
to confirm it. Many a time the thought had arisen in her mind, but only to be
driven back again, that her uncle was not as open in regard to that night's
doings as he ought to be. Had it been possible that such an accusation, such a
suspicion, whether openly made or only implied, had been brought against
herself, she should have stood boldly forth to confront her accusers and assert
her innocence, have taken Heaven to witness to it, if needs were. He had not
done this; he had never spoken of it voluntarily, good or bad; in short, he
shunned the subject--and it left an unsatisfactory impression. What should Mr.
Castlemaine want in the chapel ruins at that midnight hour?--what could he want?
But if it was he who went in why did he deny it? Put it that it was really Mr.
Castlemaine, why then the inference was that he must know what became of
Anthony. It seemed very strange altogether; a curious, unaccountable, mysterious
affair. Mary felt it to be so. Not that she lost an iota of faith in her uncle;
she seemed to trust him as she would have trusted her father; but her mind was
troubled, her brain was in a chaos of confusion.</p>
<p>In some such confusion as she stepped bodily into a minute later. At the gate
of the Nunnery she found herself in the midst of a small crowd, a small excited
number of people who were running up and jostled her. Women were crying and
panting, girls were pushing: a man with some object covered up in his arms, was
in the midst. When the garb of Miss Castlemaine was recognized in the gloom as
that of the Grey Sisters, all fell respectfully back.</p>
<p>&quot;What is amiss, good people!&quot; asked Sister Mary Ursula. And a faint moan of
sympathy escaped her as she heard the answer. Polly Gleeson, one of Tim
Gleeson's numerous little ones, had set her night-gown on fire and was terribly
burnt. Tim was somewhere abroad, as usual: but another man had offered to bring
the child to the Grey Ladies--the usual refuge for accidents and sickness.</p>
<p>Admitted to the Nunnery, the little sufferer was carried up to one of the
small beds always kept in readiness. Sister Mildred herself, who was great in
burns, came to her at once, directing two of the Sisters what was to be done.
The sobbing mother, Nancy Gleeson, who was a great simpleton but had a hard life
of it on the whole, asked whether she might not stay and watch by Polly for the
night: but the Ladies recommended her to go home to her other children and to
leave Polly to them in all confidence. Sister Mildred pronounced the burns,
though bad to look at and very painful, not to be attended with danger: should
the latter arise, she promised Nancy Gleeson to send for her at once. So Nancy
went away pacified, the crowd attending her; and the good Ladies were left to
their charge and to the night-watch it entailed.</p>
<p>But Sister Mary Ursula had recognized, among the women and girls pressing
round the gate, the face of Jane Hallet. She recognized the dress also, as the
one she had seen before that night.</p>
<p>Meanwhile John Bent reached the coastguard station. After chatting with the
sick woman's husband, Henry Mann, who happened to be off duty and at home, John
departed again with his empty basket. He chanced to be on the side opposite the
Friar's Keep; for that path led direct from the preventive station--just as the
two Sisters, Ann and Rachel, had taken it rather more than an hour earlier. John
Bent, quite unconscious of what had happened to them, walked along leisurely,
his mind full of the interview just held with Miss Castlemaine. In passing the
Friar's Keep he cast his eyes up to it. Few people passed it at night without
casting up their eyes--for the fascination that superstition has for most of us
is irresistible. Were we told that a ghost was in the next lane, a large
percentage of us would run off to see it. Even as John looked, a faint light
dawned on the casement from within: and there came into view the figure, bearing
its lamp. It was probably just at that selfsame moment that the eyes of Madame
Guise, gazing stealthily from the window of Mr. Castlemaine's study, were
regaled with the same sight. John Bent did not like it any more than madame did;
any more than the Sisters did. He took to his heels, and arrived at the Dolphin
in a state of cold chill indescribable.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h4><a name="div1_19" href="#div1Ref_19">CHAPTER XIX.</a></h4>
<h5>JANE HALLET.</h5>
<br>

<p>Greylands lay, calm and monotonous, basking under the morning sun. There were
no signs of any of the commotion that had stirred it the previous night: no
crowding people surrounding a sad little burden; no women's cries; and John
Bent's propriety had come back to him. Greylands had heard the news from one end
to the other--the Grey Monk had been abroad again. It had appeared to two of the
Sisters and to the landlord of the Dolphin.</p>
<p>The burnt child, an intelligent girl of five years old, lay in the little
bed, Sister Phoebe sitting with her. The window of the room faced the road; it
had upright iron bars before it: originally placed there, perhaps, to prevent
the nuns putting their heads out to take a sly peep at the world. Polly Gleeson
was in less pain, and lay quietly. Mr. Parker had looked in, and confirmed
Sister Mildred's opinion that she would do well.</p>
<p>The door opened gently, and there entered Sister Mary Ursula and Miss Reene.
Ethel, hearing of the accident, had come down from Greylands' Rest. Sister
Phoeby rose, smiling and nodding, and they approached the bed.</p>
<p>&quot;She is ever so much better,&quot; said the watching Sister. &quot;See, she does not
cry at all.&quot;</p>
<p>Polly was a pretty little girl. Her brown hair lay around her on the bolster;
her dark eyes smiled at the ladies. The face was not touched, and nothing could
be seen of the injuries as she lay: the worst of them were about the chest and
shoulders. Tears stood in Ethel's eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Poor little Polly!&quot; she said, stooping gently to kiss her. &quot;How did it
happen, little one?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Billy took the candle to look for a marble on the floor, and I looked too;
and then there come a great light and mother screeched out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But were you not in bed before that time, Folly? It was past nine o'clock.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mother was undressing of us then: she'd been a busy washing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Poor little darling! Well, Polly, you will be well soon; and you must take
great care of candles after this.&quot;</p>
<p>Polly gave as emphatic a nod as the bolster allowed her; as much as to say
she would never go within wide range of a candle again. Miss Castlemaine took
Sister Phoeby's place, and the latter went away.</p>
<p>That the child was now at ease, appeared evident; for presently her eyelids,
heavy with sleep, gradually closed. She had had no sleep all night. Mary Ursula
took some work from her pocket. The Sisters were making garments for this child:
all she had--and a poor &quot;all&quot; it was--had been from the floor by the terrified
mother, and caught up rolled round her to put the fire out.</p>
<p>&quot;How peaceful it seems here,&quot; said Ethel in a low tone. &quot;I think I should
like to come and be a Sister with you, Mary.&quot;</p>
<p>Miss Castlemaine smiled one of her sad smiles. &quot;That would never do, Ethel.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is so useful a life.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You will find usefulness in another sphere. It would not be <i>right</i>
that you should bury yourself here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We all told you that, Mary, you know, at Greylands' Rest. But you have done
it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My dear, the cases are essentially different. My hopes of happiness, my
prospects in the world were over: yours, Ethel, are not even yet in the bud.
When some good man shall woo and win you, you will find where your proper sphere
of usefulness lies.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't want to be won,&quot; spoke Ethel: just as young girls are given to say.
&quot;I'm sure I would ten times be a Grey Sister than marry Harry Castlemaine.&quot;</p>
<p>Mary looked up with unusual quickness. The words brought to her mind one of
the incidents of the past night.</p>
<p>&quot;Harry does not continue to tease you, does he, Ethel?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes he does. I thought he had left it off: but this morning he brought the
subject up again--and he let everybody hear him!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What did he say?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not very much. It was when he was going out of the room after breakfast. He
turned his head to me and said he hoped I should soon be ready with my answer to
the question he had put to me more than once. Papa and mamma must have
understood what he meant. I could have thrown the loaf after him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think he must be only doing it in joke, Ethel,&quot; was the slow, thoughtful
rejoinder.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know whether he is or not. Sometimes I think he is; at others I
think he is in earnest: whichever it may he, I dislike it very much. Not for the
whole world would I marry Harry Castlemaine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ethel, I fancy--I am not sure, but I fancy--you have no real cause to fear
he will press it, or to let it trouble you. Harry is hardly staid enough yet to
settle down. He does many random things.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We have had quite a commotion at home this morning,&quot; resumed Ethel, passing
to another topic. &quot;Somebody locked Flora in her bedroom last night--when she
wanted to run out this morning as usual, the door was fast. Mamma has been so
angry: and when the news of Polly Gleeson's accident came up just now, she began
again, saying Flora might just as well have been burnt also as not, burnt to
death.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who locked her in?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know--unless it was Madame Guise. Papa and mamma and I were at
dinner at Stilborough--at the Barclays', Mary. Harry would not go. It was a nice
party. We had singing in the evening.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But about the door?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, Madame Guise thought she might have unintentionally done it. She said
she went in last night to look at Flora. I can scarcely think she did it, for
she had gone in many a time and never turned the key before. Or the keys of
other doors, either.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;At least, it does not seem to have been of any consequence.</p>
<p>&quot;No; only mamma made it so. I tell you every little trifle that I can, Mary,&quot;
she added, laughing quietly. &quot;Shut up here, it seems to me that you must like to
hear news from the outer world.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And so I do,&quot; was the answer. &quot;I have not lost all interest in my fellow
pilgrims, I assure you, Ethel.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wore my black net trimmed with white satin ribbons: you can't think how
nice it looked, Mary,&quot; said Miss Ethel, some of her vanity creeping to the fore.
&quot;And a silver flower in my hair.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have no doubt the dress and the flower did look well, considering what a
pretty girl it was adorning,&quot; was Mary's reply. And Ethel blushed slightly. She
knew how nice-looking she was.</p>
<p>&quot;Does Madame Guise continue to suit?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, quite well. Mrs. Castlemaine thinks there's nobody to equal her. I like
her also; but at times she puzzles me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How does she puzzle you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I can hardly explain it. She seems strange at times. But I must be
going,&quot; added Ethel, rising.</p>
<p>&quot;You are in a hurry, Ethel.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have to go up the cliff to Miss Hallet's. Jane is hem-stitching some
handkerchiefs for mamma. Mamma had one of them with her last night: Mrs. Barclay
saw the work, and said she would like some done for herself. So I am to tell
Jane to call at Mrs. Barclay's the next time she goes to Stilborough. The work
is really beautiful: it is the broad hem-stitch, you know, Mary: four or five
rows of it.&quot;</p>
<p>A few more words spoken in the same low tone, lest the sleeping child should
be disturbed, and Ethel took her departure. Opposite the beach she encountered
Mrs. Bent: who was crossing back home in her cherry-ribboned cap from a purchase
at Pike's tea and general shop.</p>
<p>&quot;A nice day again, Miss Ethel!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is a lovely day,&quot; said Ethel, stopping; for she and Mrs. Bent were great
friends. &quot;I have been in to see poor Polly Gleeson. How badly she is burnt!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The only wonder is that it never happened before, with that imbecile of a
mother,&quot; was Mrs. Bent's tart rejoinder. &quot;Of all incapable women, Nancy
Gleeson's about the worst. Fancy her letting the children play with a candle in
their night-gowns! Where could her senses have been?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it is a sad thing for Polly. But the Sisters say she will do well. Oh,
by the way, Mrs. Bent,&quot; continued Ethel, turning as she was going onward, &quot;will
you let mamma have your receipt for stewed eels again? The new cook does not do
them to her mind and mamma cannot tell where the fault lies.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's the best receipt for eels in the three kingdoms,&quot; spoke Mrs. Bent with
pride. &quot;It was my mother's before me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Will you step across for it now, Miss Ethel?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not now: as I come back. I am going up the cliff.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To that Nancy Gleeson's, I suppose,&quot; cried Mrs. Bent in her free manner.
&quot;She does not deserve it. If I had twenty children about me, I'll be bound not
one of 'em should ever set itself alight in my presence.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not there,&quot; said Ethel slightly laughing at Mrs. Bent's tartness. &quot;I am
taking a message from mamma to Jane Hallet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I hope it is to warn her not to make herself so free with Mr. Harry,&quot; cried
Mrs. Bent, speaking on the moment's impulse. Had she taken time for thought she
would not have said it.</p>
<p>&quot;Warn her not to make herself so free with Mr. Harry!&quot; repeated Ethel,
somewhat haughtily. &quot;Why, Mrs. Bent what can you mean?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I have seen them walking together after nightfall,&quot; said Mrs. Bent,
unable to eat her words.</p>
<p>&quot;They may have met accidentally,&quot; returned Ethel after a pause.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, of course, they <i>may</i>,&quot; assented Mrs. Bent in a significant tone.</p>
<p>&quot;Since when have you seen them?&quot; pursued Ethel, feeling surprised and rather
scandalized.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, well, I can't tell that. Since last autumn, though. No harm may be
meant, Miss Ethel; I don't say it is; and none may come of it: but young girls
in Jane Hallet's position ought to take better care of themselves than to give
rise to talk.&quot;</p>
<p>Ethel continued her way to the cliff in some annoyance. While Mr. Harry
Castlemaine made a pretence of addressing herself, it was not agreeable to hear
that he was flirting with the village girls. It's true Ethel did not intend to
listen to his suit: she absolutely rejected it; but that made little difference.
Neither in itself was this walking with Jane Hallet the right thing. What if he
made Ana fond of him? many a possibility was more unlikely than that. As to any
&quot;harm&quot; arising, as Mrs. Bent had just phrased it, Ethel did not fear that--did
not, in fact, cast a thought to it. Jane Hallet was far superior to the general
run of girls at Greylands. She had been well educated by the Grey Ladies,
morally and else, having gone to school to them daily for years; she was modest
and reticent in manner; and Ethel would as soon believe a breath of scandal
could tarnish herself as Jane. Her brother, George Hallet, who was drowned, had
been made a sort of companion of by Harry Castlemaine during the last year or
two of his life, as Greylands well remembered: and Ethel came to the conclusion
that the intimacy Mrs. Bent talked of must be a sort of remnant of that
friendship, meaning nothing: and so she dismissed it from her mind. Mrs. Bent,
as Ethel knew, was rather given to find fault with her neighbours' doings.</p>
<p>Now it happened that as Ethel was ascending the cliff, Jane Hallet, within
the pretty cottage near the top of it, was being taken to task by her aunt for
the same fault that Mrs. Bent had spoken of--the staying abroad after nightfall.
Miss Hallet had latterly found much occasion to speak on this score; but Jane
was invariably ready with some plausible excuse; so that Miss Hallet, naturally
unsuspicious, and trusting Jane as she would have trusted herself, never made
much by the argument.</p>
<p>After taking the cambric handkerchief to Greylands' Rest the previous
evening, Jane had gone home, swallowed her tea hastily, put off the best things
that her aunt grumbled at her for having put on and then sat down to work. Some
article was wanted in the house; and at dusk Jane ran down in her dark cloak to
get it. From which expedition she did not get back until half-past nine was
turned: and she seemed to have come up like one running for a wager. Miss Hallet
was then ill with an attack of spasms, and Jane remained unreproved. This
morning when the housework was done, and they had begun their sewing, Miss
Hallet had leisure to recur to it. Jane sat by the window, busy at one of the
handkerchiefs. The sun shone on her bright flaxen hair; the light print dress
she wore was neat and nice--as Jane's dresses always were.</p>
<p>&quot;How long does it take to get from here to Pike's shop and back again, Jane?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;From here to Pike's shop and back again, aunt?--I could do it in a short ten
minutes,&quot; said unsuspicious Jane, fancying her aunt might be wanting to send her
there. &quot;It would take you longer, of course.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How did it happen then last night that it took you two hours and ten
minutes?&quot; demanded Miss Hallet. &quot;You left here soon after half past seven, and
you did not get back till close upon ten.&quot;</p>
<p>The soft colour in Jane's face grew bright on a sudden. She held her work to
the window, as though some difficulty had occurred in the cambric.</p>
<p>&quot;After buying the sugar, I went into the parlour to say good evening to Susan
Pike, aunt. And then there came that dreadful outcry about Nancy Gleeson's poor
burnt child.&quot;</p>
<p>The truth, but not the whole truth. Miss Jane had stayed three minutes with
Susan Pike; and the commotion about the child had occurred some two hours later.
The intervening time she did not allude to, or account for. Miss Hallet, never
thinking to inquire minutely into time, so far accepted the explanation.</p>
<p>&quot;If Nancy Gleeson's children had all been burnt, that's no reason why you
should stay out all that while.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nearly everybody was out, aunt. It was like a fair around the Nunnery gate.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You go off here; you go off there; pretty nigh every evening you dance out
somewhere. I'm sure I never did so when I was a girl.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When it is too dusk to see to work and too soon to light the candle, a run
down the cliff does no harm,&quot; returned Jane.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, but you stay when once you are down. It comes of that propensity of
yours for gossip, Jane. Once you get into the company of Susan Pike or that idle
Patty Nettleby, you take as much thought of time as you might if all the clocks
stopped still for you.&quot;</p>
<p>Jane bent to bite off a needleful of cotton--by which her flushed face was
hidden.</p>
<p>&quot;There you are! How often have I told you not to bite your thread! Many a set
of teeth as good as yours has been ruined by it. I had the habit once; but my
lady broke me of it. Use your scissors, and--Dear me! here's Miss Reene.&quot;</p>
<p>Ethel came in. Jane stood up to receive her and to hear her message. The
girl's face was shy, and her manner was very retiring. Ethel thought of what she
had just heard; certainly Jane looked pretty enough to attract Mr. Harry
Castlemaine. But the blue eyes, raised to hers, were honest and good; and Ethel
believed Jane was good also.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you: yes, I shall be glad to do the handkerchiefs for Mrs. Barclay,&quot;
said Jane. &quot;But I shall not be going into Stilborough for a week or so: I was
there yesterday. And of course I should not begin them until I have finished
Mrs. Castlemaine's.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very well; I suppose Mrs. Barclay is in no particular hurry,&quot; said Ethel.</p>
<p>&quot;Jane might get through more work if she chose,&quot; remarked Miss Hallet. &quot;Not
that I wish her to do any: it is her own will entirely. On the other hand, I
have no objection to it: and as she is fond of finer clothes than I should
purchase for her, she has to get them for herself. Just before you came in, Miss
Reene, I was telling her how she fritters away her time. Once dusk has set in,
down she goes to her acquaintances in the village, and there she stays with one
and another of them, never heeding anything else. It is a great waste of time.&quot;</p>
<p>Of all the hot faces, Jane's at that moment was the hottest. She was standing
before Miss Reene, going on with her work as she stood. Ethel wondered why she
coloured so.</p>
<p>&quot;To-night she stays at Susan Pike's; to-morrow night it's at Martha
Nettleby's; the next night it's at old. Mother Dance's, under the cliff!&quot; went
on Miss Hallet. &quot;Chattering with one gossip and another, and dancing after burnt
children, and what not, Jane never lacks an excuse for idling away her
evenings.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mrs. Castlemaine said something about having her initials worked on these
handkerchiefs: do you know whether she wishes it done, Miss Reene?&quot; interposed
Jane, who seemed to be flurried by the lecture. &quot;I did not like to ask about it
yesterday afternoon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know at all,&quot; said Ethel &quot;You had better see Mrs. Castlemaine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very well, ma'am.&quot;</p>
<p>Ethel went down the cliff again, tripping along the zigzag path. Other paths
branched off to other cottages. She took one that brought her to the door of Tim
Gleeson's hut: a poor place of two rooms, with a low roof. Tim, a very idle,
improvident, easy, and in general good-tempered man, sat on a stone at the door,
his blue cloth legs stretched out, his rough face gloomy. &quot;You are not in the
boat to-day, Tim,&quot; remarked Ethel.</p>
<p>&quot;Not to-day, Miss Castlemaine,&quot; said the man, slowly rising. &quot;I'm a going out
with the next tide. This accident have took all strength out of me! When a lot
of 'em come fizzing into the Dolphin last night, a saying our Polly was afire,
you might ha' knocked me down with a feather. Mrs. Bent she went on at me like
anything, she did--as if it was my fault! Telling me she'd like to shut the inn
doors again' me, for I went there when I ought to be elsewhere, and that I
warn't good for my salt. I'd rather it had been any of 'em nor Polly: she's such
a nice little thing, she is.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is your wife indoors?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No; she's off to the Nunnery. I've vowed to her that if she ever gets
another end o' candle in the house, I'll make her eat it,&quot; concluded Tim,
savagely.</p>
<p>&quot;But she must have a candle to see with.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't care: I won't have the young 'uns burnt like this. Thanks to you,
miss, for turning out o' your way to think on us. The brats be a squalling
indoors. I've just give 'em a licking all round.&quot;</p>
<p>Ethel ran on, and gained the Dolphin, entering it by the more familiar door
that stood open opposite the beach. Mr. and Mrs. Bent were both in the room: he,
reading his favourite weekly newspaper by the fire, the Stilborough Herald: she,
sitting at the table under the window, stoning a plate of raisins. The receipt
Ethel had asked for lay ready.</p>
<p>&quot;You'll please tell Mrs. Castlemaine, Miss Ethel, that more or less pounded
mace can be put according to taste,&quot; observed the landlady, as she handed Ethel
the paper. &quot;There's no particular quantity specified. It's strong: and a little
of it goes a great way.&quot;</p>
<p>Ethel sat down by the table, putting a raisin into her mouth. John, who had
risen to greet her, resumed his seat again. To say the truth, Miss Ethel liked
running into the Dolphin: it made an agreeable interlude to the general dulness
of Greylands' Rest. The screen introduced into the room during the late wintry
weather, had been taken away again. Mrs. Bent had a great mind to break it up,
and burn it; but for that screen Ethel Reene would not have overheard those
dangerous words. But no allusion had been made to the affair since, by any one
of them: all three seemed content to ignore it.</p>
<p>&quot;You must excuse my going on with my work, Miss Ethel,&quot; said Mrs. Bent.
&quot;We've got a dinner on to-night, and I had no notice of it till a few minutes
ago. Some grand Inspector-General of the coastguard stations is here to-day; and
he and two or three more gentlemen are going to dine here this evening. Mr.
Castlemaine, I fancy, is to be one of them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Castlemaine is!&quot; cried Ethel.</p>
<p>&quot;Either him or Mr. Harry. I b'lieve it's him. And me with not a raisin in the
house stoned for plum-pudding! I must make haste if I am to get it boiled. It's
not often I'm taken unawares like this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you will give me an apron to put on, I'll help you to stone them,&quot; said
Ethel, taking off her black gloves.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, Miss Ethel! As if I'd let you do anything of the kind! But that's just
like you--always ready to do anybody a good turn.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You give me the apron, please.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I couldn't. If any of them from Greylands' Rest happened to look in, they'd
be fit to snap at me; and at you, too, Miss Ethel. Seeing you stoning plums,
indeed! There's no need, either: I am three parts through them.&quot;</p>
<p>Ethel began to do a few without the apron, in a desultory kind of way, and
eat two or three more. John Bent came to some paragraph in the newspaper that
excited his ire.</p>
<p>&quot;Hear this!&quot; he cried in anger. &quot;Hear it, Miss Ethel! What a shame!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<i>We have been given to understand that the rumour so freely circulated
during this past week, of a matrimonial engagement having been made between Mr.
Blake-Gordon and the heiress of Mountsorrel, has had no foundation in fact</i>.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The villain!&quot; cried Mrs. Bent, momentarily forgetting her work. &quot;He can
hardly be bad enough to think of another yet.&quot;</p>
<p>Ethel's work was arrested too. She gazed at John Bent, a raisin in one hand,
a stone in the other. That any man could be so fickle-hearted as this, she had
not believed.</p>
<p>&quot;I knew the tale was going about,&quot; said the landlord; &quot;I heard it talked of
in Stilborough last market day, Miss Ethel. Any way, true or untrue, they say he
is a good deal over at the Mountsorrels, and----&quot;</p>
<p>John Bent brought his words to a standstill; rose, and laid down his
newspaper. There had entered a rather peculiar looking elderly gentleman, tall
and upright yet, with a stout walking stick in his hand. He wore a long blue
coat with wide skirts and brass buttons, drab breeches and top boots. His hair
was long and snow white, his dark eyes were fiery.</p>
<p>Taking off his broad-brimmed hat with old fashioned courtesy, he looked round
the room, particularly at Mrs. Bent and Ethel stoning the raisins. It is just
possible he mistook the latter for a daughter of the house, dressed in her
Sunday best.</p>
<p>&quot;This <i>is</i> the Dolphin, I think!&quot; he cried dubiously.</p>
<p>&quot;At your service, sir,&quot; said John.</p>
<p>&quot;Ay, I thought so. But the door seems altered. Its a good many years since I
was here. Oh--ay,--I see. Front door on the other side. And you are its
landlord--John Bent.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, sir, I used to be.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just so. We shall do. I have walked over from Stilborough to see you. I want
to know the truth of this dreadful report--that has but now reached my ears.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The report, sir?&quot; returned John--and it was perhaps natural that he should
have his head filled at the moment with Mr. Blake-Gordon and the report touching
<i>him</i>. &quot;I believe I don't know anything about it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not know anything about it! But I am told that you know all about it. Come!&quot;</p>
<p>Ethel was rubbing her hands on Mrs. Bent's cloth preparatory to drawing on
her gloves to depart. To help stone raisins in private at the inn was one thing;
to help when visitors came in was a different thing altogether. John Bent,
looked back at the stranger.</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps we are at cross-purposes, sir. If you will tell me what you mean, I
may be able to answer you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Him that I would ask about is the son of the friend of my early days, Basil
the Careless. Young Anthony Castlemaine.&quot;</p>
<p>The change of ideas from Mr. Blake-Gordon to the unfortunate Anthony was
sudden: John Bent gave a groan, and coughed it down. The gentleman resumed,
after turning to look at Ethel as she went out.</p>
<p>&quot;Is it true that he, Basil Castlemaine's son, came over the seas to this
place a month or two ago?--and took up his abode at this inn?--and put in a
claim to his grandfather's estate, Greylands' Rest? Is that true?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And where is he, this young Anthony?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know, sir. I wish I did know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is it true that he disappeared in some singular way one night--and that he
has never since been seen or heard of?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's true, sir--more's the pity.&quot;</p>
<p>The questioner took a step nearer John Bent, and dropped his voice to a low,
solemn key.</p>
<p>&quot;<i>I am told that foul play has been at work</i>.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Foul play?&quot; stammered John, not knowing whether this strange old man might
be friend or foe--whether he might have come there to call him to account for
his random words. The stranger paused to notice his changing face, and then
resumed.</p>
<p>&quot;That the young man has been put out of the way by his uncle--James
Castlemaine.&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h4><a name="div1_20" href="#div1Ref_20">CHAPTER XX.</a></h4>
<h5>AN UNWELCOME INTRUDER.</h5>
<br>

<p>The usual dinner hour at Greylands' Rest was half past one o'clock. Mr.
Castlemaine would have preferred a late dinner--but circumstances are sometimes
stronger than we are. However, he never failed to put it off until evening upon
the very slightest plea of excuse.</p>
<p>Some years before the close of old Anthony Castlemaine's life, his health
failed. It was not so much a serious illness as a long and general ailing. His
medical attendant insisted upon his dining early; and the dinner hour was
altered from six o'clock to half past one. He recovered, and lived on: some
years: but the early dinner hour was adhered to. James had never liked this
early dining: and after his father's death he wished to return to the later
hour. His wife, however, opposed it. <i>She</i> preferred the early dinner and
the social supper; and she insisted upon it to Mr. Castlemaine that the
interests of Ethel and Flora required that they should continue to dine early.
Mr. Castlemaine said he did not see that: Ethel was old enough to dine late, and
Flora might make her dinner at lunch time. Yes, poor child, and have cold meat
three days out of the seven, urged Mrs. Castlemaine. The Master of Greylands
yielded the point as a general rule: but on special occasion--and he made
special occasions out of nothing--his edict was issued for the later dinner.</p>
<p>The dinner was just over to-day, and the servants had withdrawn, leaving wine
and dessert on the table. Mr. Castlemaine's sitting down had been partly a
matter of courtesy, though he did eat a small portion of meat: he was going to
dine in the evening at the Dolphin. The early afternoon sun streamed into the
dining-room: a long, comfortable room with a low ceiling, its windows on the
side opposite the fire, its handsome sideboard, surmounted with plate glass, at
one end; some open book-shelves, well filled with good and attractive volumes at
the other. Mr. and Mrs. Castlemaine, Ethel, Flora, and Madame Guise, sat at the
table. Harry Castlemaine had retired, and his chair stood vacant. As a rule,
Madame Guise never sat a minute longer at any meal then she could help: as soon
as she could get up without an absolute breach of good manners, she did get up.
Mrs. Castlemaine called it a peculiarity. She estimated Madame Guise highly as
an instructress, but she admitted to her more intimate friends that she did not
understand her. To-day, as it chanced (chanced! do these things ever occur by
chance?) she had stayed: and she sat in her place at Mr. Castlemaine's left hand
in her perfectly-fitting black dress, with its white cuffs and collar, and her
wealth of auburn hair shading her pale and quiet face. Mr. Castlemaine was in a
sociable mood: latterly he had been often too silent and abstracted. His back
was to the sideboard as he sat; handsome, upright, well-dressed as usual. Ethel
was on his right hand, the windows behind her, Harry's empty chair between her
and Mrs. Castlemaine; and Miss Flora, eating almonds and raisins as fast as she
could eat them, sat on the other side of her mother with her back to the fire,
and next to Madame.</p>
<p>Mrs. Castlemaine had introduced the subject that was very much in her
thoughts just now--a visit to Paris. The Master of Greylands was purposing to
make a trip thither this spring; and his wife, to her great delight, had
obtained permission to accompany him. She had never been across the water in her
life: the days of universal travelling had not then set in: and there were
moments when she felt a jealousy of Ethel. Ethel had finished her education in
the French capital; and was, so far, that much wiser than herself.</p>
<p>&quot;I long to see Versailles;--and St. Cloud;--and the Palais Royal,&quot; spoke Mrs.
Castlemaine in a glow of enthusiasm. &quot;I want to walk about amid the orange-trees
in pots; and in the Champs Elyses; and at Pre la Chaise. And I particularly
wish to see the Gobelins Tapestry, and the people working at it. <i>You</i> must
be quite familiar with all these sights, Madame Guise.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have seen scarcely any of them,&quot; said Madame Guise in her gentle way.
Then, perceiving the surprised look on Mrs. Castlemaine's face, she resumed
hurriedly. &quot;We did not live very near Paris, madam,--as I think I have said. And
we French girls are kept so strictly:--and my mother was an invalid.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And the bonbon shops!&quot; pursued Mrs. Castlemaine. &quot;I do count much on seeing
the bonbon shops: they must be a sight in themselves. And the lovely
bonnets!--and the jewellery! What is it that Paris has been called?--the
Paradise of women?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;May I go too?&quot; asked Ethel with animation, these attractive allusions
calling up reminiscences of her own sojourn in Paris.</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; curtly replied Mrs. Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, mamma! Why, you will be glad of me to take you about and to speak French
for you!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I shall go, mamma,&quot; quickly spoke up Flora, her mouth full of cake. &quot;You
told me I should, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We will see, my darling,&quot; said Mrs. Castlemaine, not daring to be too
self-asserting just then; though her full intention was to take Flora if she
could contrive it by hook or by crook. &quot;A trip to Paris would be an excellent
thing for you,&quot; she added for the benefit of Mr. Castlemaine: &quot;it would improve
your French accent and form your manners. I'll see, my dear one.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Castlemaine gave a quiet nod and smile to Ethel, as much as to say, &quot;<i>I</i>
will see for you.&quot; In fact he had all along meant Ethel to be of the party;
though he would certainly do his best to leave Miss Flora at home.</p>
<p>At this moment Flora ought to be practising, instead of greedily eating of
every dessert dish within her reach: but oughts did not go for much with Miss
Flora Castlemaine. They might have gone for nothing but for Madame Guise. That
lady, rising now from her chair, with a deprecatory bow to Mrs. Castlemaine for
permission, reminded her pupil that she and the piano were both waiting her
pleasure.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't want to have a music lesson this afternoon; I don't want to
practise,&quot; grumbled Flora.</p>
<p>&quot;As you did not get your studies over this morning in sufficient time to take
your lesson or to practise before dinner, you must do both now,&quot; spoke Madame in
her steady way. And Mr. Castlemaine gave the young lady a nod of authority, from
which she knew there might be no appeal.</p>
<p>&quot;In a minute, papa. Please let me finish my orange.&quot;</p>
<p>She was pushing the quarters of an orange into her month with the silver
fork. Just then Miles came into the room and addressed his master.</p>
<p>&quot;You are wanted, sir, if you please.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who is it?&quot; asked Mr. Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know, sir. Some oldish gentleman; a stranger. He asked----&quot;</p>
<p>The man's explanation was cut short by the appearance of the visitor himself;
who had followed, without permission, from the room to which he had been shown:
a tall, erect, elderly man, attired in an ample blue coat and top-boots. His
white hair was long, his dark eyes were keen. The latter seemed to take in the
room and its inmates; his glance passing rapidly from each to each, as he stood
holding his broad-brimmed hat and his stout walking-stick. Ethel knew him.
instantly for the stranger who had entered the Dolphin Inn while she was helping
Mrs. Bent with the raisins an hour, or so, ago: and the probability was that he
recognized her, for his eyes rested on her for a few seconds.</p>
<p>Mr. Castlemaine had risen. He went a step or two forward as if about to
speak, but seemed to be uncertain. The stranger abruptly forestalled him.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you know me, James Castlemaine?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why--yes--is it not Squire Dobie?&quot; replied Mr. Castlemaine, holding out his
hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Just so,&quot; replied the stranger, keeping his hands down. &quot;Perhaps you won't
care to take my hand when you know that I have come here as a foe.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As a foe?&quot; repeated Mr. Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;At present. Until I get an answer to the question I have come to put. What
have you done with Basil's son?&quot;</p>
<p>A change passed over the face of Mr. Castlemaine: it was evident to anybody
who might be looking at him; a dark look, succeeded by a flush. Squire Dobie
broke the momentary silence.</p>
<p>&quot;My old friend Basil's son; Basil the Careless: young Anthony Castlemaine.&quot;</p>
<p>The Master of Greylands was himself again. &quot;I do not understand you,&quot; he
said, with slow distinctness. &quot;I have done nothing with the young man.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then rumour belies you, James Castlemaine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I assure you, Squire Dobie, that I know no more whither young Anthony
Castlemaine went, or where he is now than you know. It has been a mystery to
myself, as to every one else at Greylands.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I got home to Dobie Hall last week,&quot; continued the stranger; &quot;mean to stay
at it, now; have only made flying visits to it since it became mine through poor
Tom's death. Drove into Stilborough yesterday for the first time; put up at the
Turk's Head. Landlord, old Will Heyton, waited on me himself this morning at
breakfast, talking of the changes and what not, that years have brought, since I
and poor Tom, and Basil the Reckless, and other rollicking blades used to
torment the inn in the years gone by. We got to speak of Basil; 'twas only
natural; and he told me that Basil had died abroad about last Christmas tune;
and that his son, named Anthony, had come over soon after to put in his claim to
his patrimony, Greylands' Rest. He said that Anthony had suddenly disappeared
one night; and was thought to have been <i>made away with</i>.&quot;</p>
<p>During this short explanation, they had not moved. The speaker stood just
within the door, which Miles had closed, Mr. Castlemaine facing him a few paces
distant. Madame Guise, waiting for Flora, had turned to the stranger, her face
changing to the pallor of the grave. The Master of Greylands caught sight of the
pallor, and it angered him: angered him that one should dare to speak of this
remarkably unsatisfactory topic in the presence of the ladies of his family,
startling and puzzling them. But he controlled his voice and manner to a kind of
indifferent courtesy.</p>
<p>&quot;If you will take a seat--and a glass of wine with me, Squire Dobie, I will
give you all the information I possess on the subject of young Anthony's
disappearance. It is not much; it does not really amount to anything: but such
as it is, you shall hear it.--My wife, Mrs. Castlemaine. Sophia,&quot; turning to her
as he made the introduction, &quot;you had finished, I know: be so good as to leave
us to ourselves.&quot;</p>
<p>They filed out of the room: Flora first, with Madame Guise; Ethel and her
stepmother following. The latter, who knew something of the Dobie family, at
least by reputation, halted to exchange a few words with the representative of
it as she passed him. To judge by her manner, it seemed that she had put no
offensive construction on his address to her husband: and the probability was
that she did not. Mrs. Castlemaine might have been less aware than anybody of
the disagreeable rumours whispered in Greylands, tacitly if not openly
connecting her husband with the doings of that ill-fated night: for who would be
likely to speak of them to <i>her?</i></p>
<p>Squire Dobie, remarking that he did not like to sit with his back to the fire
passed round the table and took the chair vacated by Ethel. He was the second
son of the old Squire Dobie, of Dobie Hall, a fine old place and property nearly
on the confines of the county. In the years gone by, as he had phrased it, he
and his elder brother, Tom the heir, had been very intimate with Basil
Castlemaine. Separation soon came. Basil went off on his impromptu travels
abroad--from which, as the reader knows, he never returned; Tom Dobie, the heir,
remained with his father at the Hall, never marrying: Alfred, this younger son,
married a Yorkshire heiress, and took up his abode on her broad acres. It has
been mentioned that Tom Dobie kept up a private occasional correspondence with
Basil Castlemaine, and knew where he was settled, but that has nothing to do
with the present moment. Some two years ago Tom died. His father, the old
Squire, survived him by a year: and at his death the Hall fell to Alfred, who
became Squire in his turn: he who had now intruded on Mr. Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;No thank you; no wine,&quot; he said, as Mr. Castlemaine was putting the decanter
towards him. &quot;I never drink between my meals; and I've ordered my dinner for six
o'clock at the Turk's Head. I await your explanation, James Castlemaine. What
did you do with young Anthony?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;May I ask whether Will Heyton told you I had done anything with him?&quot;
returned Mr. Castlemaine, in as sarcastic a tone as the very extreme limit of
civility allowed him to use.</p>
<p>&quot;No. Will Heyton simply said the young man had disappeared; that he had been
seen to enter that queer place, the Friar's Keep, at midnight, with, or closely
following upon the Master of Greylands. When I inquired whether the whether the
Master of Greylands was supposed to have <i>caused</i> him to disappear, old
Will simply shrugged his shoulders, and looked more innocent than a baby. The
story affected me, James Castlemaine; I went out from the breakfast-table,
calling here, calling there, upon the people I had formerly known in the town. I
got talking of it with them all, and heard the same tale over and over again.
None accused you, mind; but I gather what their <i>thoughts</i> were: that you
must have had a personal hand in the disappearance of Anthony; or, at least, a
personal knowledge of what became of him.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Castlemaine had listened in silence; perfectly unmoved. Squire Dobie
regarded him keenly with his dark and searching eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;I know but little of the matter; less, apparently, than you know,&quot; he
quietly said. &quot;I am ready to tell you what that little is--but it will not help
you, Squire Dobie.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean in saying less than I know?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because I never was near the Friar's Keep at all on that night. Your
informants, I presume, must have been, by their assuming to know so much.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They know nothing. It is all conjecture.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, all conjecture,&quot; returned Mr. Castlemaine, with the air of one suddenly
enlightened. &quot;And you come here and accuse me on conjecture? I ought to feel
supremely indebted to you, Alfred Dobie.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What they do say--that is not conjecture--is, that it was you who preceded
Basil's son into the Keep.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who says it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Basil's son said it, and thought it: it was only that that took him in, poor
fellow. The landlord of the inn here, John Bent, saw it and says it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But John Bent was mistaken. And you have only his word, remember, for
asserting what Basil's son saw or said.&quot;</p>
<p>Squire Dobie paused, looking full at his host, as if he could gather by looks
whether he was deceiving him or not.</p>
<p>&quot;Was it, or was it not you, who went into the Keep, James Castlemaine?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was not. I have said from the first, I repeat it to you now, that I was
not near the Keep that night: unless you call Teague's Hutt near it. As a matter
of fact, the Hutt is near it, of course; but we estimate distances
relatively----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know how near it is,&quot; interrupted Squire Dobie. &quot;I came round that way
just now, up the lane; and took sounding of the places.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good. I went down to Teague's that night--you have no doubt heard all about
the why and the wherefore. I smoked a pipe with Teague while making the
arrangements to go for a sail with him on the morrow; and I came straight back
again from the Hutt here, getting home at half-past eleven. I hear that Teague
says he watched me up the lane: which I am sure I was not conscious of.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You were at home here by half-past eleven?&quot; spoke Squire Dobie.</p>
<p>&quot;It had not gone the half hour.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And did not go down the lane again?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly not. I had nothing to go for. On the following morning, before it
was light, I was roused from my bed by tidings of the death of my brother Peter,
and I went off at once to Stilborough.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Poor Peter!&quot; exclaimed the Squire. &quot;What a nice steady young fellow he
was!--just the opposite of Basil. And what a name he afterwards made for
himself!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When I returned to Greylands in the afternoon,&quot; quietly went on Mr.
Castlemaine, &quot;and found that Anthony was said to have disappeared unaccountably,
and that my name was being bandied about in connection with it, you may imagine
my astonishment.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, if you were really ignorant.&quot;</p>
<p>The Master of Greylands half rose from his chair, and then resumed it. His
spirit, subdued hitherto, was quickening.</p>
<p>&quot;Forbearance has its limits, Squire Dobie; so has courtesy. Will you inform
me by what right you come into my house and persist in these most offensive and
aspersive questions?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;By the right of my former friendship for your brother Basil. I have no
children of my own: never had any; and when I heard this tale, my heart warmed
to poor Basil's son: I resolved to take up his cause, and try to discover what
had become of him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pardon me, that does not give you the right to intrude here with these
outspoken suspicions.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think it does. The suspicions are abroad, James Castlemaine; ignore the
fact to yourself as you may. Your name is cautiously used: people must be
cautious, you know: not used at all perhaps in any way that could be laid hold
of. One old fellow, indeed, whispered a pretty broad word; but caught it up
again when half said.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who was he?&quot; asked the Master of Greylands.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll be shot if I tell you. John Bent? No, that it was not: John Bent seems
as prudent as the rest of them. Look here, James Castlemaine: if an impression
exists against you, you must not blame people, but circumstances. Look at the
facts. Young Anthony comes over to claim his property which you hold, believing
it to be his. You tell him it is not his, that it is yours; but you simply <i>
tell</i> him this; you do not, in spite of his earnest request, prove it to him.
There's bad blood between you: at any rate, there is on your side; and you have
an open encounter in a field, where you abuse him and try to strike him. That
same night he and John Bent, being abroad together, see you cross the road from
this Chapel Lane, that leads direct from your house, you know, and enter the
Friar's Keep; young Anthony runs over in your wake, and enters it also: and from
that blessed moment he is never seen by mortal eyes again. People outside hear a
shot and a scream--and that's all. Look dispassionately at the circumstances for
yourself, and see if they do not afford grounds for suspicion.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If all the facts were true--yes. The most essential link in them is without
foundation--that it was I who went into the Friar's Keep. Let me put a question
to you--what object can you possibly suppose I should have in quitting my house
at midnight to pay a visit to that ghostly place?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know. It puzzles everybody.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If John Bent is really correct in his assertions, that some one did cross
from the lane to the Friar's Keep, I can only assume it to have been a stranger.
No inhabitant of Greylands, as I believe and now assure you Squire Dobie, would
voluntarily enter that place in the middle of the night. It has an ill
reputation for superstition: all kinds of ghostly fancies attach to it. I should
about as soon think of quitting my house at night to pay a visit to the moon as
to the Friar's Keep.&quot;</p>
<p>Squire Dobie sat in thought. All this was more than plausible; difficult to
discredit. He began to wonder whether he had not been hard upon James
Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;What is your opinion upon the disappearance?&quot; he asked. &quot;You must have
formed one.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Castlemaine lifted his dark eyebrows.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't form one,&quot; he said. &quot;Sometimes I have thought Anthony must have
attempted to run down the rocks by the uncertain path from the chapel ruins, and
have perished in the sea; at others I think he may have left Greylands
voluntarily that night, and will some day or other reappear again as
unexpectedly. His father Basil was given to these impromptu flights, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But this is all supposition?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Undoubtedly it is. Who was it, then, they watched into the Keep, you
ask?--that is the least-to-be-accounted-for statement of all. My opinion is that
no one entered it; that John Bent's eyesight deceived him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And now one more question, James,&quot; resumed the Squire, insensibly returning
to the more familiar appellation of former days: &quot;is Greylands' Rest yours, or
was it left to Basil?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is mine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did it come to you by will?&quot;</p>
<p>For a moment Mr. Castlemaine hesitated before giving an answer. The
persistent questioning annoyed him; and yet he did not know how to escape it.</p>
<p>&quot;It became mine by deed of gift.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why did you not show the deed to Anthony?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I might have done so had he waited. He was too impatient. I <i>should</i>
have done it:&quot; and the emphasis here was marked. &quot;To no one save yourself have I
acknowledged so much, Squire Dobie. I recognize in none the right to question
me.&quot;</p>
<p>Squire Dobie rose, taking his hat and stick from the side-table where he had
laid them, and held out his hand to Mr. Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;If you are an innocent man, James, and I have said what cannot be justified,
I heartily beg your pardon. Perhaps time will clear up the mystery. Meanwhile,
if you will come over to Dobie Hall, and bring your family to stay a few days, I
shall be glad to welcome you. Who was that nice-looking, delicate featured woman
with the light hair?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;With the light hair?--oh, my little daughter's governess. Madame Guise; a
French lady.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And the very pretty girl who was sitting by you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Miss Reene. She is my wife's stepdaughter.&quot;</p>
<p>Squire Dobie took his departure, Mr. Castlemaine walking with him to the
hall-door. When outside, the Squire stood for an instant as if deliberating
which way to choose--the avenue, or the obscure by-way of Chapel Lane. He took
the latter.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll see this Commodore Teague and hear his version of it,&quot; he said to
himself as he went on. &quot;James Castlemaine speaks fairly, but doubts of him still
linger on my mind: though why they should I know not.&quot;</p>
<p>Walking briskly up the lane, as he turned into it, came a tall, handsome
young fellow, who bore a great resemblance to the Castlemaines. Squire Dobie
accosted him.</p>
<p>&quot;You should be James Castlemaine's son, young man.&quot;</p>
<p>Harry stopped.</p>
<p>&quot;I am the son of the Master of Greylands.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ay. Can't mistake a Castlemaine. I am Squire Dobie. You've heard of the
Dobies?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh dear, yes. I knew Mr. Tom Dobie and the old Squire.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To be sure. Well, there's only me left of them. I have been to pay a visit
to your father.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I hope you found him at home, sir.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, and have been talking with him. Well you are a fine young fellow: over
six feet, I suppose. I wish I had a son like you! Was that poor cousin of yours,
young Anthony--who seems to have vanished more mysteriously than anybody ever
vanished yet--was he a Castlemaine?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not in height: he was rather short. But he had a regular Castlemaine face;
as nice-looking as they say my Uncle Basil used to be.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What has become of him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know. I wish I did know!&quot; Harry added earnestly.</p>
<p>They parted. That this young fellow had borne no share in the business, and
would be glad to find its elucidation, Squire Dobie saw. Turning down the little
path, when he came to it, that led to the Hutt, he knocked at the door.</p>
<p>Commodore Teague was at dinner: taking it in the kitchen to save trouble. But
he had the free and easy manners of a sailor, and ushered his unknown guest in
without ceremony, and gave him the best seat, while the Squire introduced
himself and his object in calling.</p>
<p>Squire Dobie?--come to know about that there business of young Mr.
Castlemaine's, and how he got lost and where he went to: well, in his opinion it
was all just moonshine. Yes, moonshine; and perhaps it might be also Squire
Dobie's opinion that it was moonshine, if he could get to the top and bottom of
it. Couldn't be a doubt that the young man had come out o' the Keep after going
into it--'twarn't likely he'd stay long in that there ghostly place--and went
off somewhere of his own accord. That's what he, Jack Teague, thought: though
he'd not answer for it, neither, that the young fellow might not have made a
false step on the slippery rock path, and gone head foremost down to Davy
Jones's locker. The shot and scream? Didn't believe there ever was a scream that
night; thought John Bent dreamt it; and the shot came from him, Teague; after
cleaning his gun he loaded it and fired it off. The most foolish thing in it all
was to suspect the Master of Greylands of marching into the Keep. As if he'd
want to go there at midnight! or at any other time, for the matter of that. Mr.
Castlemaine went away from his place between eleven and half-after; and he, Jack
Teague, saw him go up the lane towards his house with his own eyes: 'twarn't
likely he'd come <i>down</i> it again for the purpose of waylaying young
Anthony, or what not.</p>
<p>Now, this was the substance of all that the anxious old friend of Basil
Castlemaine could obtain from Commodore Teague. The Commodore seemed to be a
rough, honest, jovial-speaking man, incapable of deceit, or of double dealing:
and, indeed, as Squire Dobie asked himself, why should he be guilty of it in
this matter? He went away fair puzzled, not knowing what to think; and leaving
the savoury smell, proceeding from the Commodore's stew getting cold on the
table. But why it should have pleased the Commodore to favour Squire Dobie with
the rough and ready manners, the loose grammar, he used to the common people of
Greylands, instead of being the gentleman that he could be when he chose, was
best known to himself.</p>
<p>Crossing the road, as he emerged from the lane, the Squire entered the chapel
ruins, and went to the edge of the land there. He saw the narrow, tortuous, and
certainly, for those who had not a steady foot and head, dangerous path that led
down to the strip of beach below: which beach was not discernible now, for it
was high water. The path was rarely trodden by man: the ill reputation of the
Friar's Keep kept the village away from it: and, otherwise, there was no
possible inducement to tempt men down it. Neither, as some instinct taught
Squire Dobie, had it been taken that night by young Anthony Castlemaine.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h4><a name="div1_21" href="#div1Ref_21">CHAPTER XXI.</a></h4>
<h5>IN THE CHAPEL RUINS.</h5>
<br>

<p>Madam Guise sat buried in a reverie. Ethel was reading a French book aloud;
Flora was practising: but Madame, supposed to be listening to both, heard
neither the one nor the other.</p>
<p>Every minute of the hours that had passed since she saw the diamond ring of
her unfortunate husband concealed in Mr. Castlemaine's bureau had been one of
agony. The fright and horror she had experienced in the search was also telling
upon her: her head ached, her pulses throbbed, her brain was fevered: and but
for the dread of drawing attention to herself, that, in her nervousness, she
feared might lead to suspicion, she would have pleaded illness and asked
permission to remain that day in her chamber. No one but herself knew how she
shrunk from Mr. Castlemaine: she could not be in the same room with him without
feeling faint; to sit next to him at the dinner-table, to be inadvertently
touched by him, was nothing less than torture. The finding of the ring was a
proof to her that her husband had in truth met with the awful fate suspected;
the concealment of the ring in the bureau, a sure and certain sign that Mr.
Castlemaine was its author. When they were intruded upon at table by Squire
Dobie with his accusing words, Charlotte Guise had been scarcely able to
suppress her emotion. Mr. Castlemaine, in catching sight of the pallor of her
face, had attributed it simply to the abrupt mention of the disagreeable
subject: could he have suspected its true cause he had been far more put out
than even by Squire Dobie's words. An idea had crossed Charlotte Guise--what if
she were to declare herself to this good old gentleman, and beseech him to take
up her cause.</p>
<p>But she did not dare. It was this she was thinking of now, when she ought to
have been attending to Miss Flora's imperfect fingering. There were reasons why
she might not; why, as she clearly saw, it might do her harm instead of good.
With the one sole exception of the ring, there was no shadow of proof against
Mr. Castlemaine: and upon the first slight breathing of hostilities, how quickly
might he not do away with the ring for ever! And, once let it be declared that
she was Anthony's wife, that her chief business in the house was to endeavour to
track out the past, she would be expelled from it summarily and the door closed
against her. How could she pursue her search then? No, she must not risk it; she
must bury the ring in silence, and stay at her post.</p>
<p>&quot;I <i>should</i> think I've practised long enough, for one afternoon,
Madame!&quot;</p>
<p>Flora gave a final dash at the keys as she spoke--enough to set a stoic's
teeth on edge. Madame looked up languidly.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, you may shut the piano. My headache is painful and I cannot properly
attend to you.&quot;</p>
<p>No need of further permission. Flora shut down the lid with a bang, and
disappeared. Ethel closed her book.</p>
<p>&quot;I beg your pardon for my thoughtlessness, Madame Guise. I ought not to have
read to you: I forgot your headache. Can I get you anything for it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your reading has not hurt me at all, my dear. No, nothing: only time will
cure me.&quot;</p>
<p>Ethel, who had moved to the window, and was standing at it suddenly burst
into a laugh.</p>
<p>&quot;I was thinking of that old gentleman's surprise,&quot; she said, &quot;when he saw me
here. His looks expressed it. Where do you think he had seen me to-day before,
Madame Guise?&quot;</p>
<p>The mention of the old gentleman--Squire Dobie--aroused Madame's interest.
She lifted her languid head quickly. &quot;I do not know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In Mrs. Bent's best kitchen, stoning raisins. I went into the Dolphin to get
something for mamma, and began to help Mrs. Bent to do them, for she said she
should be late with her pudding. Old Squire Dobie came in and saw me at them.
When he found me at home here at dinner, I know he was puzzled.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What a--strange manner he had;--what curious things he said to Mr.
Castlemaine!&quot; spoke Madame, seizing upon the opportunity.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Ethel, flushing scarlet. &quot;I thought him very rude.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He seemed to think that--that the young Mr. Anthony I have heard tell of was
really killed in secret.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You cannot help people thinking things.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And by Mr. Castlemaine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was very wrong of him; it must be very foolish. I wonder papa took it so
calmly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<i>You</i> do not think it could be so then?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<i>I!</i> Is it likely, Madame Guise?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But suppose--my dear Miss Ethel, suppose some one were to tell you that it
was so: that they had proof of it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Proof of what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Proof that Mr. Castlemaine did know what became of An--of the Mr. Anthony:
proof that harm came to him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I should laugh at them,&quot; said Ethel.</p>
<p>&quot;And not believe it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, never.&quot;</p>
<p>Ethel left the room with the last words: perhaps to avoid the topic. Madame
thought so, and sighed as she looked after her. It was only natural she thought:
when we are fond of people we neither care to hear ill spoken of them, nor
believe the ill; and Ethel was very fond of Mr. Castlemaine. Charlotte Guise did
not wonder: but for this dreadful suspicion, she would have liked him herself.
In fact she had insensibly began to like him, in spite of her prejudices, until
this new and most convincing proof of his guilt was discovered in his bureau:
the search for which had cost her conscience so much to set about, had taxed her
fears so cruelly in the act, and was giving her so intense a torment now. &quot;I
wonder what will come of it all in the end?&quot; she cried with a slight shiver.
&quot;Qui vivre, verra.&quot;</p>
<p>One of the Grey Sisters appeared at Greylands' Rest by-and-by, bringing up
little Marie Guise. It was Sister Ruth. Mrs. Castlemaine had graciously invited
the child to take tea with her mother. But Mrs. Castlemaine was one who rarely
did a kindness without some inward motive--generally a selfish one. Marie was
beginning to speak a little English now; but never willingly; never when her
French could be by any possibility understood. To her mother she invariably
spoke in French; and Mrs. Castlemaine had made the private discovery that, to
hear the child and her mother speak together, might improve Flora's accent. So
Madame Guise was quite at liberty to have Maxie up to tea as often as she liked.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you remember your papa, dear?&quot; asked Mrs. Castlemaine in English, as they
sat round the tea-table; Mr. Castlemaine having gone to dine at the Dolphin.</p>
<p>&quot;Sais pas, responded Marie shyly, hanging her head at the question.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you like England better than France, Marie?&quot; went on Mrs. Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;Sais pas,&quot; repeated the child unwillingly, as if she meant to cry.</p>
<p>&quot;How is the little burnt girl? Better?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sais pas, moi.&quot;</p>
<p>Evidently it was profitless work, the examining of Miss Marie Guise. Ethel
laughed, and began talking to her in French. At best, she was but a timid little
thing.</p>
<p>Madame Guise started at the dusk hour to take her home; proceeding to the
front, open way, down the wide avenue and the high road. At the door of the
Dolphin stood Mrs. Bent, a large cooking apron tied round her waist. She was
wiping a cut-glass jug with a soft cloth, and apparently had stepped to the door
while giving some directions to Ned, the man: who stood ready to run off
somewhere without his hat.</p>
<p>&quot;Mind, Ned; the very best mocha. And unless it is the best, don't bring it.
I'd sooner use what I've got in the house.&quot;</p>
<p>Ned started off across the road in the direction of the beach: no doubt to
Pike, the grocer's. Mrs. Bent was whisking in again, when she caught sight of
Madame Guise and the little Marie.</p>
<p>&quot;You are busy this evening,&quot; said Madame.</p>
<p>&quot;We've got a dinner on,&quot; replied Mrs. Bent stooping to kiss Marie, of whom
she had grown very fond during the child's sojourn and illness at the inn. &quot;And
I had no notice of it till midday--which of course makes one all the busier. I
like to get things forward the day beforehand, and not leave 'em to the last
minute: but if you don't know of it you can't do that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A dinner?--Yes, I think I heard it said at home that Mr. Castlemaine was
dining at the Dolphin.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He is here, for one. There are five of them altogether. Captain Scott--some
grand man he is, they say, who goes about to look up the coastguard in places;
and Superintendent Nettleby; and Mr. Blackett of the Grange. Lawyer Knivett of
Stilborough makes the fifth, a friend of Captain Scott's. And I must run in,
ma'am, for I'm wanted ten ways at once this evening.&quot;</p>
<p>Madame Guise passed on to the Nunnery, and entered it with the child. Sister
Betsey shook her head, intimating that it was late for the little one to come
in, considering that she had not long recovered from an illness: and she took
her away at once.</p>
<p>This left Madame Guise alone with Miss Castlemaine. Mary Ursula sat away from
the light, doing nothing: an unusual thing, for the Sisters made it a point to
be always employed. The muslin cap was on her bright hair; her mourning dress,
all crape, handsomer than was strictly consistent with the plain ideas of the
community, fell in soft folds around her. These costly robes of Sister Mary
Ursula's had been somewhat of a stumbling block in her change of existence: but,
as all the Sisters said, it would be a sin against thrift to do away with them
before they were worn out.</p>
<p>&quot;You are thinking me very idle,&quot; she said to Madame Guise in a light tone of
half apology for being caught with her hands before her. &quot;But the truth is, I am
feeling very tired this evening; unequal to work. I had a sleepless night, and
got up with headache this morning.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I too, had a sleepless night,&quot; said Madame Guise, forgetting caution in the
sympathy of the moment. &quot;Troubles were tormenting me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What troubles have you?&quot; asked Mary Ursula in a kind, gentle tone. &quot;You are
satisfied with the care the Sisters give your little one?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh quite; quite. I am sure she is happy here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you have told me that she and you are alone in the world.&quot;</p>
<p>Madame Guise untied her bonnet, and laid it on the chair beside her, before
replying.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of us have our troubles in one shape or another, I expect; sometimes
they are of a nature that we do not care to speak of. It is that thing that the
English call a skeleton in a closet. But--pardon me, Miss Castlemaine--you and I
are both young to have already found the skeleton.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;True,&quot; said Mary Ursula: and for a moment she was silent from delicacy,
intending to drop the subject. But her considerate goodness of heart induced her
to speak at again.</p>
<p>&quot;You are a lonely exile here, Madame: the land and its people are alike
strange to you. If you have any source of trouble or care that it would be a
comfort to you to share with another, or that I could in any way help to
alleviate, impart it to me. You shall find me a true friend.&quot;</p>
<p>Just for one delusive instant, the impulse to take this grand and sweet and
kindly lady into her confidence; to say to her I am trying to trace out my poor
husband's fate; swayed Charlotte Guise. The next, she remembered that it must
not be; that she was Miss Castlemaine, the niece of that great enemy.</p>
<p>&quot;You are only too good and kind,&quot; she rejoined in a sad, faint tone. &quot;I wish
I could; I should ask nothing better: but there are some of our burthens we must
bear alone.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are you quite comfortable at Greylands' Rest?&quot; asked Mary Ursula, unable to
repress the suspicion that Mrs. Castlemaine's temper or her young daughter's
insolence might be rendering the governess's place a trying one.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes--pretty well. That is, I should be,&quot; she hastily added, speaking on the
impulse of the moment, &quot;if I were quite sure the house was an honest one.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The house an honest one!&quot; echoed Mary Ursula in undisguised astonishment, a
haughty flush dying her face. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, pardon me, madam!--It may be that I mistake terms--I am not English. I
did not mean to say it was a thief's house.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But what do you mean?&quot;</p>
<p>Madame Guise looked full at the questioner. She spoke after a short
consideration, dropping her voice to a half whisper.</p>
<p>&quot;I would like to know--to feel sure--that Mr. Castlemaine did not do anything
with that poor young man, his nephew.&quot;</p>
<p>Mary Ursula sat half confounded--the rejoinder was so very unexpected, the
subject so entirely disagreeable.</p>
<p>&quot;At least, Madame Guise, that cannot be any affair of yours.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are angry with me, madam; your words are cold, your tones resentful. The
first evening that I arrived at Greylands I chanced to hear about that young
man. Mollee, the servant at the inn, came up to help me make the tisane for my
little child, and she talked. She told of the young man's strange disappearance,
saying he was supposed to have been murdered: and that Mr. Castlemaine knew of
it. Ah, it had a great effect upon me, that history; I was cold and miserable,
and my little one was ill: I could not get it away from my mind.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think you might have done so by this time,&quot; frigidly remarked Mary Ursula.</p>
<p>&quot;But it comes up now and again,&quot; she rejoined, &quot;and that keeps alive the
remembrance. Events bring it up. Only to-day, when we had not left the
dinner-table, some stranger came pushing his way into the room behind Miles,
asking Mr. Castlemaine what he had done with Basil's son, young Anthony. It put
Mr. Castlemaine out; I saw his face change; and he sent us all from the room.&quot;</p>
<p>Mary Ursula forgot her coldness. It was this very subject that had deprived
her past night of sleep: though she could no more confess it to Madame Guise
than the latter could confess. The two were playing unconsciously at
hide-and-seek with one another.</p>
<p>&quot;Who was the stranger, Madame Guise?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Castlemaine called him Squire Dobie. They were together ever so long.
Mr. Castlemaine, I say, did not like it; one might see that. Oh, when I think of
what might have happened that night to the young Anthony, it makes me shudder.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The best thing you can do is <i>not</i> to think of it, Madame Guise. It is
nothing to you, one way or the other. And it is scarcely in good taste for you
to be suspicious of Mr. Castlemaine while you are eating his bread. Rely upon
it, when this matter shall have been cleared up--if it ever be cleared--Mr.
Castlemaine will be found as good and honest as you are.&quot;</p>
<p>The bell for the Sisters' supper rang clanging out. Madame Guise put her
bonnet on, and rose.</p>
<p>&quot;Do forgive me,&quot; she whispered with deprecation. &quot;I might not to have
mentioned it to you; I did not wish to offend, or to hurt your feelings. But I
am very lonely here; I have but my own heart to commune with.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And thoughts are free,&quot; reflected Mary Ursula. &quot;It was only natural that the
mysterious story should lay hold of her.&quot; And in heart she excused the stranger.</p>
<p>&quot;Be at ease,&quot; she said, taking Madame's hand. &quot;Dismiss it from your mind. It
is not a thing that need trouble you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not trouble me!&quot; repeated Madame Guise to herself as she went through the
gate. &quot;It is me alone that it ought to trouble, of all in the wide world.&quot;</p>
<p>She turned to the right, intending to go home by Chapel Lane, instead of
crossing to the broad open front road; but to pass the Friar's Keep at any
period of the day, and especially at night, had for Charlotte Guise an
irresistible fascination. Some instinct within her, whether false or true, was
always whispering that it was there she must seek for traces of her husband.</p>
<p>She reached the gate of the chapel ruins, hesitated, and then entered it. The
same fascination that drew her to pass the Friar's Keep on her road home, caused
her to enter the ruins that led to the place. A shiver, induced by nervousness,
took her as she closed the gate behind her; and she did not pass into the Keep,
but crossed over to the edge of the cliff. The sea and the boats on it seemed
like so much company.</p>
<p>Not that many boats could be seen. Just two or three, fishing lower down
beyond the village, rather far off, in fact; but their lights proved that they
were there, and it made her feel less lonely. It was not a very light night: no
moon, and the stars did not shine over brightly; but the atmosphere was clear,
and the moss-covered wall of the Friar's Keep with its gothic door might be seen
very distinctly.</p>
<p>&quot;If I only dared go in and search about!--with a lantern or something of
that!&quot; she said to herself, glancing sideways at it. &quot;I might come upon some
token, some bit of his dress, perhaps, that had been torn away in the struggle.
For a struggle there must have been. Anthony was brave, and he would not let
them take his life without having a fight for it. Unless they shot him without
warning!&quot;</p>
<p>Burying her face in her hands, she shudderingly rehearsed over to herself
what that struggle had probably been. It was foolish of her to do this, for it
gave her unnecessary pain: but she had got into the habit of indulging these
thoughts instead of checking them; and perhaps they came unbidden. You must not
cherish your sorrow, we say to some friend who is overwhelmed with grief and
despair. No, answers the poor sufferer: but how can I help it? Just so was it
with Charlotte Guise. Day by day, night by night, she saw only her husband and
his unhappy fate; she was as a sick person in some fever dream, whose poor brain
has seized hold of one idea and rambles upon it for ever.</p>
<p>&quot;There's the ring in Mr. Castlemaine's bureau!--and if I could find some
other token of his person here, elucidation might come of it,&quot; she resumed,
lifting her head. &quot;A button; a glove; a torn bit of cloth?--I should know them
all. It is <i>pnible</i> to continue to lead this false life! As I am, unknown,
I can do nothing. I may not even ask John Bent to let me take just one look at
his dear effects, or as much as open the lid of his small desk. While I am
Madame Guise, it is no affair of mine, I should be told; I must not concern
myself with it: but if I might show to the world that I am Charlotte
Castlemaine, the right would be all mine. It is awkward; because I may not show
it to them: and I can only search out traces in secret; that Friar's Keep may
hold proofs of what his fate has been, if I could but go in and look for them.&quot;</p>
<p>She turned her head towards the old building, but not very courageously: at
the best, it was but a ghostly-looking place at night: and then turned it back
and gazed out to sea again.</p>
<p>&quot;No. I should not have the bravery to go in alone; even if I could secure a
lantern. There's that revenant that comes; and it might appear to me. I saw it
as distinctly last night from Mr. Castlemaine's window as I ever saw anything in
my life. And if I were in the place, and it appeared to me, I should die of
fear.--I think I half died of fear last night when I heard the voice of Mr.
Harry,&quot; she went on, after a pause: &quot;there was he, before me, and there was the
revenant, over here, behind me; and----&quot;</p>
<p>Some sound behind her at this moment nearly made Charlotte Guise start out of
her skin. When buried in ghostly visions--say, for instance, in reading a
frightful tale alone at night--we all know how a sudden noise will shake the
nerves. The gate was opening behind Charlotte, and the fright sent her bang
against the wall. There she cowered in the corner, her black clothes drawn round
her, suppressing the cry that would have risen to her lips, and, praying to
escape detection.</p>
<p>She did escape it. Thanks to the shade cast by the angle of projecting wall,
and to her dark clothes, she remained unseen. It was Harry Castlemaine who had
entered. He advanced to the edge of the cliff, but not near to her, and stood
there for a few moments, apparently looking out to sea. Then he pushed open the
gothic door, and passed into the Friar's Keep.</p>
<p>What was Charlotte Guise to do? Should she make a dart for the gate, to get
away, running the risk of his coming out again and pouncing upon her; or should
she stay where she was until he had gone again? She decided for the former, for
her present situation was intolerable. After all, if he did see her, she must
make the excuse that she had crossed the ruins to take a look at the beautiful
sea: he could not surely suspect anything from that!</p>
<p>But this was not to be accomplished. She was just about to glide away from
her hiding place, when the gate again opened, and some other figure, after
looking cautiously about, came gliding into the ruins. A woman's light figure,
enveloped in a dark cloak, its hood concealing the head and partly the face. It
crossed the ruins cautiously, with a side look steadily directed to the Keep
door, as if to guard against surprise, and then stood at the edge, under cover
of the Keep, gazing attentively out to sea. Madame Guise was at the opposite
corner close to the wall of the Nunnery, and watched all this. By the glimpse of
the profile turned sideways to her, she thought it was the young girl they
called Jane Hallet.</p>
<p>Slowly turning away from the sea, the girl was apparently about to steal back
again, when she suddenly drew herself flat against the old moss-eaten wall of
the Friar's Keep, and crouched down there. At the same moment, Harry Castlemaine
came out of the Keep, strode with a quick step to the gate, and passed through
it. The girl had evidently heard him coming out, and wished to avoid him. He
crossed the road to Chapel Lane; and she, after taking another steady look
across the sea, quitted the ruins also, and went scuttering down the hill in the
direction of her home.</p>
<p>Charlotte Guise breathed again. Apart from her husband's disappearance and
the tales of the revenant she so dreaded, Charlotte could not help thinking that
things connected with the Friar's Keep looked romantic and mysterious. Giving
ample time for Harry Castlemaine to have got half way up the lane on his road
home, she entered the lane herself, after glancing up at the two windows, behind
which the Grey Friar was wont to appear. All was dark and silent there to-night.
She had not gone ten paces up the lane, when quick, firm footsteps were heard
behind her: those of the Master of Greylands. Not caring to encounter him, still
less that he should know she chose that lonely road for returning home at night,
she drew aside among the trees while he passed. He turned down to the Hutt, and
Madame Guise went hastening onwards.</p>
<p>Mr. Castlemaine was on his way homewards from the dinner at the Dolphin. When
the party broke up, he had given his arm to Nettleby the superintendent; who had
decidedly taken as much as he could conveniently carry. It pleased the Master of
Greylands, in spite of his social superiority, to make much of the
superintendent as a general rule; he was always cordial with him. Captain Scott
had taken the same--for in those days hard drinking was thought less ill of than
it is in these--and had fallen fast asleep in one of John Bent's good
old-fashioned chairs. As Mr. Castlemaine came out of the superintendent's gate
after seeing him safely indoors, he found Lawyer Knivett there.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, Knivett, is it you?&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;I thought you and the captain were
already on your road to Stilborough.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Time enough,&quot; replied the lawyer. &quot;Will you take a stroll on the beach? It's
a nice night.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Castlemaine put his arm within the speaker's, and they crossed over in
that direction. Both of them were sober as judges. It was hardly light enough to
see much of the beauty of the sea; but Mr. Knivett professed to enjoy it, saying
he did not get the chance of its sight or its breezes at Stilborough. In point
of fact, he had something to say to the Master of Greylands, and did not care to
enter upon the subject abruptly.</p>
<p>&quot;Weary work, it must be, for those night fishermen!&quot; remarked the lawyer,
pointing to two or three stationary lights in the distance.</p>
<p>&quot;They are used to it, Knivett.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I suppose so. Use goes a great way in this life. By the way, Mr.
Castlemaine--it has just occurred to me--I wish you'd let me give you a word of
advice, and receive it in good part.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What is it? Speak out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Could you not manage to show the deed of tenure by which you own Greylands'
Rest?&quot; pursued the lawyer, insensibly dropping his voice.</p>
<p>&quot;I suppose I could if I chose,&quot; replied Mr. Castlemaine, after a scarcely
perceptible pause.</p>
<p>&quot;Then I should recommend you to do so. I have wanted to say this to you for
some little time; but the truth is, I did not know how you would take it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<i>Why</i> have you wanted to say it to me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well--the fact is, people are talking. People will talk, you know--great
idiots! If you could contrive to let somebody see the deed--of course you'd not
seem to show it purposely--by which you hold the property, the world would be
convinced that you had no cause to--to wish young Anthony out of the way, and
would stop its blatant tongue. <i>Do so</i>, Mr. Castlemaine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I conclude you mean to insinuate that the world is saying <i>I</i> put
Anthony out of the way.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Something of that. Oh, people are foolish simpletons at the best. Of course,
there's nothing in it; they are sure of that; but, don't you perceive, once let
them know that young Anthony's pretensions had not a leg to stand upon, and
they'd see there was no mo----in fact, they'd shut up at once,&quot; broke off the
lawyer, feeling that he might be treading on dangerous ground. &quot;If you have the
deed at hand, let it be seen one of these first fine days by some worthy man
whose word can be taken.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And that would stop the tongues you say?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Undoubtedly it would. It would be a proof that you, at least, could have no
motive for wishing Anthony elsewhere,&quot; added the lawyer more boldly.</p>
<p>&quot;Then, listen to my answer, Knivett: NO. I will never show it for any such
purpose; never as long as I live. If the world likes to talk, let it talk.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It does talk,&quot; urged the lawyer ruefully.</p>
<p>&quot;It is quite welcome to talk, for me. I am astonished at you, Knivett; you
might have known me better than to suggest such a thing. But that you were so
valued by my father, and respected by me, I should have knocked you down.&quot;</p>
<p>The haughty spirit of the Master of Greylands had been aroused by the
insinuation: he spoke coldly, proudly, and resentfully. Mr. Knivett knitted his
brow: but he had partly expected this.</p>
<p>&quot;The suggestion was made in friendliness,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course. But it was a mistake. We will forget it, Knivett.&quot;</p>
<p>They shook hands in silence. Mr. Knivett crossed over to the inn, where the
fly waited to convey himself and Captain Scott to Stilborough; and the Master of
Greylands had then commenced his walk homewards, taking the road that would lead
him through Chapel Lane.</p>

<h4><a name="div1_22" href="#div1Ref_22">CHAPTER XXII.</a></h4>
<h5>MISS HALLET IN THE DUST.</h5>
<br>

<p>Miss Hallet stood in the parlour of her pretty cottage on the cliff. For a
wonder, she was doing nothing--being usually a most industrious body. As she
stood upright in deep thought, her spare, straight, up-and-down figure
motionless, her pale face still, it might be seen that some matter was troubling
her mind. The matter was this: Jane (as she phrased it to herself) was getting
beyond her.</p>
<p>A week or more had elapsed since the night Jane had made the accident to
Polly Gleeson an excuse for staying out late. Children could not be burnt every
night,--and yet the fault continued. Each night, since then, had she been out,
and stayed later than she ought to stay: a great deal later than her aunt
considered was at all proper or expedient. On the previous night, Miss Hallet
had essayed to stop it. When Jane put on her cloak to take what she called her
run down the cliff, Miss Hallet in her stern, quiet way, had said, &quot;You are not
going this evening, Jane.&quot; Jane's answer had been, &quot;I must go, aunt; I have
something to do&quot;--and went.</p>
<p>&quot;What's to be done if she won't mind me?&quot; deliberated Miss Hallet. &quot;I can't
lock her up: she's too old for it. What she can possibly want, flying down the
cliff night after night, passes my comprehension. As to sitting with Goody Dance
or any other old fish-wife, as Jane sometimes tells me she has been doing, I
don't believe a word of it. Its not in the nature of young girls to shut
themselves up so much with the aged. Why, I have heard Jane call <i>me</i> old
behind my back--and I want a good twenty or thirty years of old Dame Dance's
age.&quot;</p>
<p>Miss Hand stopped a minute, to listen to sounds overhead. Jane was up there
making the beds. She soon resumed her reflections.</p>
<p>&quot;No, it's not Mother Dance, or any other old mother. It's her love of tattle
and gossip. When young girls can get together, they'd talk of the moon if there
was no other subject at hand--chattering geese! But that there's not a young
chap in all the village that Jane would condescend to look at, I might think she
had picked up a sweetheart. She holds herself too high for any of them. And
quite right too: she <i>is</i> above them. They are but a parcel of poor
fishers: and as to that young Pike, who serves in his father's shop, he has no
more sense in him, and Jane knows it, than a kite's tail. No, it's not
sweethearts! it's dawdling and gossip along with Susan Pike and the rest of the
foolish girls. But oh, how things have changed!--to think that Jane Hallet
should consort with such!&quot;</p>
<p>Miss Hallet lifted her eyes to the ceiling, as though she could see through
it what Jane was about. By the sound it seemed that she was sweeping the carpet.</p>
<p>&quot;She is a good girl on the whole; I own that,&quot; went on Miss Hallet. &quot;Up
betimes in a morning, and keeping steady to whatever she has to do, whether it
may be housework or sewing: and never gadding in the day-time. The run in the
evening does her good, she says: perhaps so: but the staying late doesn't. I
don't like to be harsh with her,&quot; continued Miss Hallet, after a pause. &quot;She
stands alone, save for me, now her brother's gone--and she grieves after him
still. Moreover, I am not sure that Jane would stand any harsh authority, if I
did put it forth. Poor George would not--though I am sure I only wanted to
control him for his good: he went off and made a home for himself down in the
village: and Jane has a touch of her brother's spirit. There's the difficulty.&quot;</p>
<p>At this moment Jane ran down the stairs with a broom and dust-pan, and went
into the kitchen. Presently she came forth in her bonnet and shawl, a small
basket in her hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Where are you off to?&quot; asked Miss Hallet snappishly. For if she did
acknowledge to herself that Jane was a good girl, there was no necessity to let
Jane know it. And Miss Hallet was one of those rigid, well-meaning people who
can hardly ever speak to friend or foe without appearing cross. All for their
good, of course: as this tart tone was for Jane's.</p>
<p>&quot;To buy the eggs, aunt. You told me I was to go for them when I had done the
rooms.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll go for the eggs myself,&quot; said Miss Hallet, &quot;I'll not be beholden to you
to do my errands. Take your bonnet off and get to your work. Those handkerchiefs
of Mrs. Castlemaine's don't seem to progress very quickly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They are all finished but one, aunt. There have been the initial letters to
work--which Mrs. Castlemaine decided afterwards to have done; and the letters
take time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Put off your things, I say.&quot;</p>
<p>Jane went away with her bonnet and shawl, came back, and sat down to her
sewing. She did not say, Why are you so angry with me? she knew quite well why
it was, and preferred to avoid unsatisfactory topics. Miss Hallet deliberately
attired herself, and went out for the eggs. They kept no servant: the ordinary
work of the house was light: and when rougher labour was required, washing and
cleaning, a woman came in from the village to do it. The Hallets were originally
of fairly good descent. Miss Hallet had been well reared, and her instincts were
undoubtedly those of a gentlewoman: but when in early life she found that she
would have to turn out in the world and work for her living, it was a blow that
she never could get over. A feeling of blight took possession of her even now
when she looked back at that time. In the course of years she retired on the
money bequeathed to her, and on some savings of her own. Her brother (who had
never risen higher than to be the captain of a small schooner) had then become a
widower with two children. He died: and these children were left to the mercy of
the world, very much as he and his sister had been left some twenty years
before. Miss Hallet took to them. George was drowned: it has been already
stated: Jane was with her still; and, as the reader sees, was not altogether
giving satisfaction. In Miss Hallet's opinion, Jane's destiny was already fixed:
she would lead a single life, and grow gradually into an old maid, as she
herself had done. Miss Hallet considered it the best destiny Jane could invoke:
whether it was or not, there seemed to be no help for it. Men whom she would
have deemed Jane's equals, were above them in position: and she believed Jane
would not look at an inferior. So Miss Hallet had continued to live on in her
somewhat isolated life; civil to the people around her but associating with
none; and always conscious that her fortunes and her just merits were at
variance.</p>
<p>She attired herself in a rather handsome shawl and close straw bonnet, and
went down the cliff after the required eggs. Jane sat at the open parlour
window, busy over the last of Mrs. Castlemaine's handkerchiefs. She wore her
neat morning print gown, with its small white collar and bow of fresh lilac
ribbon, and looked cool and pretty. Miss Hallet grumbled frightfully at anything
like extravagance in dress; but at the same time would have rated Jane soundly
had she seen her untidy or anything but nice in any one particular. When the
echo of her aunt's footsteps had fully died away, Jane laid the handkerchief on
the table, and took from her pocket some other material, which she began to work
at stealthily.</p>
<p>That's the right word for it--stealthily. For she glanced cautiously around
as if the very moss on the cliff side would take note of it, and she kept her
ears well on the alert, to guard against surprise. Miss Hallet had told her she
did not get on very quickly with the handkerchiefs: but Miss Hallet did not
know, or suspect, that when times were propitious--namely, when she herself was
away from observation, or Jane safely shut up in her own room--the handkerchiefs
were discarded for this other work. And yet, the work regarded casually,
presented no private or ugly features. It looked like a strip of fine lawn, and
was just as nice-looking and snowy as the cambric on the table.</p>
<p>Jane's fingers plied quickly their needle and thread. Presently she slipped a
pattern of thin paper out of her pocket, unfolded it, and began to cut the lawn
according to its fashion. While thus occupied, her attentive ear caught the
sound of approaching footsteps: in a trice, pattern and work were in her pocket
again out of sight, and she was diligently pursuing the hem-stitching of the
handkerchief.</p>
<p>A tall, plain girl, with straggling curls of a deep red darkened the window:
Miss Susan Pike, daughter of Pike, the well-to-do grocer and general dealer.
Deep down in Jane Hallet's heart there had always lain an instinctive
consciousness, warning her that she was superior to this girl, as well as to
Matty Nettleby, of quite a different order altogether: but the young crave
companionship, and will have it, suitable or unsuitable, where it is to be had.
The only young <i>lady</i> in the place was Ethel Reene, and Jane Hallet's good
sense told her that that companionship would be just as unsuitable the other
way: she might as well aspire to covet an intimacy with a duchess's daughter as
with Miss Reene.</p>
<p>&quot;Weil, you <i>are</i> hard at work this morning, Jane!&quot; was Miss Susan Pike's
unceremonious and somewhat resentful salutation, as she put her hands upon the
window-sill and, her head inside. For she did not at all favour work herself.</p>
<p>&quot;Will you come in, Susan?&quot; returned Jane, rising and unslipping the bolt of
the door: which she had slipped after the departure of her aunt.</p>
<p>&quot;Them are Mrs. Castlemaine's handkerchiefs, I suppose,&quot; observed Susan,
responding to the invitation and taking a chair. &quot;Grand fine cambric, ain't it!
Well, Jane, you do hem-stitch well, I must say.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have to work her initials on them also,&quot; remarked Jane. &quot;S.C.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;S.C.,&quot; repeated Miss Pike. &quot;What do the S. stand for? What's her Chris'en
name?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sophia.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sophia!--that is a smart name. Do you work the letters in satin stitch?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. With the dots on each side it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You learnt all that fine hem-stitching and braider-work at the Nunnery,
Jane--and your aunt knows how to do it too, I suppose. <i>I</i> shouldn't have
patience for it. I'd rather lade out treacle all day: and of all precious
disagreeable articles our shop serves, treacle's the worst. I hate it--sticking
one's hands, and messing the scales. I broke a basin yesterday morning, lading
it out,&quot; continued Miss Susan: &quot;let it slip through my fingers. Sister Phoebe
came in for a pound of it, to make the ladies a pudding for dinner, she said;
and I let her basin drop. Didn't mother rate me!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did Sister Phoebe say how the child was getting on?--Polly Gleeson.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Polly's three parts well, I think. Old Parker does not go across there any
more. I say, Jane, I came up to ask if you'd come along with me to Stilborough
this afternoon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can't,&quot; said Jane. &quot;My aunt has been very angry with me this morning. I
should no more dare to ask her to let me go to Stilborough to-day than I should
dare to fly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What has she been angry about?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, about my not getting on with my work, and one thing or other,&quot; replied
Jane carelessly. &quot;She would not let me fetch some eggs just now; she's gone
herself. And she knows that in a few days' time I shall have to go to
Stilborough on my own account.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She's a nice article for an aunt!&quot; grumbled Miss Susan. &quot;I've got to order
in some things for the shop, and I thought it would be pleasant for us two to
walk there together. You are sure you can't come Jane?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Quite sure. It is of no use talking of it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I must ask Matty Nettleby, then. But I'd rather have had you.&quot;</p>
<p>Miss Susan, who was somewhat younger than Jane, and wore dirty pink bonnet
strings, which did not contrast well with the red curls, and a tumbled, untidy
frock (but who would no doubt go off on her expedition to Stilborough finer than
an African queen) fingered discontentedly, one by one, the scissors, cotton, and
other articles in Jane's work-box. She was not of good temper.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it's a bother! I can't think what right aunts have to domineer over
folks! And I must be off to keep shop, or I shall have mother about me. Father's
got one of his liver bouts, and is lying abed till dinner-time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wish you'd bring me a pound of wool from Stilborough, Susan? You know
where I buy it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let's have the number, then.&quot;</p>
<p>Jane gave her a skein of the size and colour wanted, and the money for the
purchase. &quot;I'll come down for it this evening,&quot; she said. &quot;You'll be back then.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All right. Good-bye, Jane.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good-bye,&quot; returned Jane. And as the damsel's fleet steps betook her down
the cliff, Jane bolted the door again, put the cambric handkerchief aside, and
took the private work out of her pocket.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Miss Hallet had reached the village. Not very speedily. When she
went out--which was but seldom--she liked to take her leisure over it. She
turned aside to Tim Gleeson's cottage, to inquire after Polly; she halted at the
door of two or three more poor fishermen's huts to give the good morrow, or ask
after the little ones. Miss Hallet's face was cold, her manner harsh: but she
could feel for the troubles of the world, and she gave what help she could to
the poor folks around her.</p>
<p>The old woman from whom she bought her eggs, lived in a small cottage past
the Dolphin Inn. Miss Hallet got her basket filled--she and Jane often had eggs
and bread and butter for dinner to save cooking--paid, and talked a bit with the
woman. In returning, Mrs. Bent was at the inn door, in her chintz gown and
cherry cap ribbons.</p>
<p>&quot;Is it you, Miss Hallet! How are you this morning?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Quite well, thank you,&quot; replied Miss Hallet in her prim way.</p>
<p>&quot;Been getting some eggs, I see,&quot; ran on Mrs. Bent, unceremoniously. &quot;It's not
often <i>you</i> come down to do your own errands. Where's Jane?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I left her at work,&quot; was the answer. &quot;Jane does not get through her sewing
as quickly as she might, and I have been telling her of it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You can't put old heads upon young shoulders,&quot; cried Mrs. Bent. &quot;Girls like
to be idle; and that's the truth. What do you suppose I caught that Molly of
mine at, last night? Stuck down at the kitchen table, writing a love-letter.&quot;</p>
<p>Miss Hallet had her eyes bent on her eggs, as though she were counting them.</p>
<p>&quot;Writing a letter, if you'll believe me! And, a fine thing of a letter it
was! Smudged with ink and the writing like nothing on earth but spiders' legs in
a fit. I ordered it put on the fire. She's not going to waste her time in
scribbling to sweethearts while she stays with me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did she rebel?&quot; quickly asked Miss Hallet.</p>
<p>&quot;Rebel! Molly! I should like to see her attempt it. She was just as sheepish
as a calf at being found out, and sent the paper into the fire quicker than I
could order it in.&quot;</p>
<p>Gossip about Mrs. Bent's Molly, or any other Molly, was never satisfactory to
Miss Hallet. She broke the subject by inquiring after John Bent's health,
preparatory to pursuing her way.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, he's well enough,&quot; was Mrs. Bent's answer. &quot;It's not often men get
anything the matter with them. If they were possessed of as much common sense as
they are of health, I'd say it was a blessing. That weak-souled husband of mine,
seeing Molly piping and sniffing last night, told me privately that he saw no
harm in love-letters. He'd see no harm in a score of donkeys prancing over his
young plants and other garden stuff next, leave him alone.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am glad Mr. Bent is well,&quot; said Miss Hallet, taking a step onwards. &quot;Jane
told me last week he was ill.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He had a bilious attack. Jane came in the same night and saw him with his
head on a cushion. By the way--look here, Miss Hallet--talking about Jane--I'd
not let her be out quite so much after dark, if I were you.&quot;</p>
<p>No words could have been more unwelcome to Miss Hallet than these. She was a
very proud woman, never brooking advice of any kind. In her heart she regarded
Jane as being so infinitely superior to all Greylands, the Greylands' Rest
family and the doctor's excepted, that any reproach cast on her seemed nothing
less than a presumption. It might please herself to reflect upon her niece for
gadding about, but it did not please her that others should.</p>
<p>&quot;Young girls like their fling; I know that,&quot; went on Mrs. Bent, who never
stayed her tongue for anybody. &quot;To coop 'em up in a pen, like a parcel of old
hens, doesn't do. But there's reason in all things: and it seems to me that
Jane's out night after night.'</p>
<p>&quot;My niece comes down the cliff for a run at dusk, when it is too dark for her
to see to sew,&quot; stiffly responded Miss Hallet. &quot;I have yet to learn, Mrs. Bent,
what harm the run can do to her or to you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;None to me, for certain; I hope none to her. I see her in Mr. Harry
Castlemaine's company a little oftener than I should choose a girl of mine to be
in it. I do not say it is for any harm; don't take up that notion, Miss Hallet;
but Mr. Harry's not the right sort of man, being a gentleman, for Jane to make a
companion of.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And who says Jane does make him her companion?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I do. She is with him more than's suitable. And--look here, Miss Hallet, if
I'm saying this to you, it is with a good motive and because I have a true
regard for Jane, so I hope you will take it in the friendly spirit it's meant.
If they walked together by daylight, I'd not think so much of it, though in my
opinion that would not be the proper thing, considering the difference between
them, who he is and who she is: but it is not by daylight, it is after dark.&quot;</p>
<p>Miss Hallet felt a sudden chill--as though somebody were pouring cold water
down her back. But she was bitterly resentful, and very hard of belief. Mrs.
Bent saw the proud lines of the cold face.</p>
<p>&quot;Look here, Miss Hallet. I don't say there's any harm come of it, or likely
to come: if I'd thought that, I'd have told you before. Girls are more heedless
than the wind, and when they are as pretty as Jane is young men like to talk to
them. Mr. Harry is in and about the village at night--he often says to me how
dull his own home is--and he and Jane chance to meet somewhere or other, and
they talk and laugh together, roaming about while they do it. That's the worst
of it, I hope: but it is not a prudent thing for Jane to do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Jane stays down here with her friends; she is never at a loss for
companions,&quot; resentfully spoke Miss Hallet. &quot;She sits with old Goody Dance: and
she is a good deal with Miss Nettleby and with Pike's daughter; sometimes
staying in one place, sometimes in another. Why, one evening last week--Thursday
was it? yes, Thursday--she said she was here, helping you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So she was here. We had a party in the best room that night. Jane ran in;
and, seeing how busy I was, she helped me to wash up the glass: she's always
good-natured and ready to forward a body. She stayed here till half-past eight
o'clock.&quot;</p>
<p>Miss Hallet's face looked doubly grim. It was nearer half-past ten than
half-past eight when Miss Jane made her appearance at home--as she well
remembered.</p>
<p>&quot;And now don't you go blowing up Jane through what I've said,&quot; enjoined Mrs.
Bent. &quot;We were young ourselves once, and liked our liberty. She's thoughtless;
that's all; if she were a few years older, she would have the sense to know that
folks might get talking about her. Just give her a caution, Miss Hallet: and
remind her that Mr. Harry Castlemaine is just about as far above her and us, as
the moon's higher than that old weather-cock a-top of the Nunnery.&quot;</p>
<p>Miss Hallet went homewards with her eggs. She had perfect confidence in Jane,
in her conduct and principles. Jane, as she believed, would never make a habit
of walking with Mr. Harry Castlemaine, or he with her: they had both too much
common sense. Unless--and a flush illumined Miss Hallet's face at the sudden
thought--unless they had fallen into some foolish, fancied love affair with one
another.</p>
<p>&quot;Such things have happened before now, of course,&quot; reasoned Miss Hallet to
herself as she began her ascent of the cliff but her tone was dubious, almost as
though she would have liked to be able to tell herself that they never had
happened. &quot;But they would know better; both of them; remembering that nothing
could come of it. As to the walking together--I believe that's three parts Mrs.
Bent's imagination. It is not <i>likely</i> to be true. Good morning, Darke!&quot;</p>
<p>A fisherman in a red cap, jolting down the cliff, had saluted Miss Hallet in
passing. She went on with her thoughts.</p>
<p>&quot;Suppose I watch Jane a bit? There's nothing I should so much hate as to
speak to her upon a topic such as this, and then find I had spoken without
cause. It would be derogatory to her and to me. Yes,&quot; added Miss Hallet with
decision, &quot;that will be the best plan. The next time Jane goes out at dusk, I'll
follow her.&quot;</p>
<p>The next time happened to be that same evening. Miss Hallet gave not a word
of scolding to Jane all day: and the latter kept diligently to her work at Mrs.
Castlemaine's handkerchief. At dusk Jane put her warm dark cloak on, and the
soft quilted bonnet.</p>
<p>&quot;Where are you going to-night?&quot; questioned Miss Hallet then, with a stress of
emphasis on the to-night.</p>
<p>&quot;Just down the cliff, aunt. I want to get the wool Susan Pike was to buy for
me at Stilborough.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Always an excuse for gadding out!&quot; exclaimed Miss Hallet.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, aunt, I must have the wool. I may be wanting it to-morrow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You'll toast me two thin bits of toast before you go,&quot; said the aunt
snappishly.</p>
<p>Jane put off her cloak and proceeded to cut the slices of bread and toast
them. But the fire was very low, and they took some considerable time to brown
properly.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you wish the toast buttered, aunt?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No. Cut it in strips. And now go and draw me my ale.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is early for supper, aunt.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You do as you are bid, Jane. If I feel cold, I suppose I am at liberty to
drink my ale a trifle earlier than usual, to warm me.&quot;</p>
<p>Jane drew the ale in a china mug that held exactly half-a-pint, and brought
it in. It was Miss Hallet's evening allowance: one she never exceeded. Her
supper frequently consisted of what she was about to take now: the strips of
toast soaked in the ale, and eaten. It was much favoured by elderly people in
those days, and was called Toast-and-ale.</p>
<p>Jane resumed her cloak, and was allowed to depart without farther hindrance.
But during the detention, the dusk of the evening had become nearly dark.
Perhaps Miss Hallet had intended this.</p>
<p>She ate a small portion of the toast very quickly, drank some of the ale,
leaving the rest for her return, and had her own bonnet and dark shawl on in no
time. Then, locking her house door for safety, she followed in the wake of Jane.</p>
<p>She saw Jane before she reached the foot of the cliff: for the latter's light
steps had been detained by encountering Tim and Nancy Gleeson, who could not be
immediately got rid of. Miss Hallet halted as a matter of precaution: it would
not answer to overtake her. Jane went onwards, and darted across the road to
Pike's shop. Miss Hallet stood in a shady angle underneath the cliff, and
waited.</p>
<p>Waited for a good half hour. At the end of that time Jane came out again, a
paper parcel in her hand. &quot;The wool,&quot; thought Miss Hallet, moving her feet
about, for they were getting cramped. &quot;And <i>now</i> where's she going? On to
the beach, I shouldn't wonder!&quot;</p>
<p>Not to the beach. Jane came back by the side of the shops, the butcher's and
the baker's and the little humble draper's, and turned the corner that led to
the Grey Nunnery. Miss Hallet cautiously crossed the road to follow her. When
Miss Hallet had her in view again, Jane had halted, and seemed to be doing
something to her cloak. The aunt managed to make out that Jane was drawing its
hood over her quilted bonnet, so as to shade her face. With the loose cloak
hiding her figure, and the hood the best part of her face, Jane's worst enemy
would not have known her speedily.</p>
<p>Away she sped again with a swift foot; not running, but walking lightly and
quickly. The stars were very bright: night reigned. Miss Hallet, spare of form,
could walk almost as quickly as Jane and she kept her in view. Onwards, past the
gate of the Nunnery, went Jane to the exceeding surprise of Miss Hallet. What
could her business be, in that lonely road?--a road that she herself, who had
more than double the years and courage of Jane, would not have especially chosen
as a promenade at night. Could Jane be going dancing up to the coastguard
station, to inquire after Henry Mann's sick wife? What simpletons young girls
were! They had no sense at all: and thought no more of appearances than----</p>
<p>A shrill noise, right over Miss Hallet's head, cut her reflections suddenly
short, and sent her with a start against the Nunnery palings. It was a bird
flying across, from seaward, which had chosen to make known his presence. The
incident did not divert her attention from the pursuit for more than an instant:
but in that instant she lost sight of Jane.</p>
<p>What an extraordinary thing! Where was she? How had she vanished? Miss Hallet
strained her eyes as she asked the questions. When the bird suddenly diverted
her attention, Jane had nearly gained the gate that led into the chapel ruins;
might perhaps have been quite abreast of it. That Jane would not go in <i>there</i>,
Miss Hallet felt quite convinced of; nobody would go in. She had not crossed the
road to Chapel Lane or Miss Hallet could not have failed to see her cross it: it
was equally certain that she was not anywhere in the road now.</p>
<p>Miss Hallet turned herself about like a bewildered woman. It was an
occurrence so strangely mysterious as to savour of unreality. The highway had no
trap-doors in it: Jane could not have been caught up into the air.</p>
<p>Miss Hallet walked slowly onwards, marvelling, and gazing about in all
directions. When opposite the chapel gate, she took courage to look through the
palings at that ghost-reputed place: but all there seemed lonely and silent as
the grave. She raised her voice in call--just as John Bent had once raised his
voice in the silent night after the ill-fated Anthony Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;Jane! Jane Hallet!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What on earth <i>can</i> have become of her?&quot; debated Miss Hallet, as no
response was made to the call. &quot;She <i>can't</i> have gone up Chapel Lane!&quot;</p>
<p>With a view to see (in spite of her conviction) whether Jane was in the lane,
Miss Hallet betook herself to cross over towards it. She went slowly; glancing
around and about her; and had got to the middle of the road when a faint light
appeared in one of the windows of the Friar's Keep. Miss Hallet had heard that
this same kind of faint light generally heralded the apparition of the Grey
Monk; and she stood transfixed with horror.</p>
<p>Sure enough! A moment later, and the figure in his grey cowl and habit glided
slowly past the window, lamp in hand. The unhappy lady gave one terror-stricken,
piercing scream, and dropped down flat in the dusty highway.</p>
<br>
<br>

<h4><a name="div1_23" href="#div1Ref_23">CHAPTER XXIII.</a></h4>
<h5>THE SECRET PASSAGE.</h5>
<br>

<p>The kitchen at the Grey Nunnery was flagged with slate-coloured stone. A
spacious apartment: though, it must be confessed, very barely furnished. A
dresser, with its shelves, holding plates and dishes; a few pots and pans; some
wooden chairs; and a large deal table in the centre of the room, were the
principal features that caught the eye.</p>
<p>The time was evening. Three of the Sisters were ironing. Or, to be quite
correct, two of them were ironing, and the other, Sister Ann, was attending to
the irons at the fire, and to the horse full of fresh ironed clothes, that stood
near it. The fire threw its ruddy glow around: upon the plates, of the old
common willow pattern, ranged on the dresser-shelves, on the tin dish-covers,
hanging against the wall, on the ironing blanket, spread on the large table. One
candle only was on the board, for the Sisters were economical, and moreover
possessed good eyesight; it was but a common dip in an upright iron candlestick,
and required to be snuffed often. Each of the two Sisters, standing side by
side, had her ironing stand on her right hand, down on which she clapped the
iron continually. They wore their muslin caps, and had on ample brown-holland
aprons that completely shielded their grey gowns, with over-sleeves of the same
material that reached up nearly to the elbow.</p>
<p>The Sisters were enjoying a little friendly dispute: for such things (and
sometimes not altogether friendly) will take place in the best regulated
communities. Some pea-soup, that had formed a portion of the dinner that day,
was not good: each of the three Sisters held her own opinion as to the cause of
its defects.</p>
<p>&quot;I tell you it was the fault of the peas,&quot; said Sister Caroline, who was cook
that week and had made the soup. &quot;You can't make good soup with bad peas. It's
not the first time they have sent us bad peas from that place.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There's nothing the matter with the peas,&quot; dissented fat little Sister
Phoeby, who had to stand in her pattens to obtain proper command of the board
whenever it was her turn to iron. &quot;I know peas when I look at them, I hope, and
I say these are good.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, they would not boil at all,&quot; retorted Sister Caroline.</p>
<p>&quot;That's because you did not soak them long enough.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Soaking or not soaking does not seem to make much difference,&quot; said the
aspersed Sister, shaking out a muslin kerchief violently before spreading it on
the blanket. &quot;The last time it was my week for cooking we had pea-soup twice. I
soaked the peas for four-and-twenty hours; and yet the soup was grumbled at!
Give me a fresh iron, please, Sister Ann.&quot;</p>
<p>Sister Ann, in taking one of the irons from between the bars of the grate,
let it fall with a crash on the purgatory. It made a fine clatter, and both the
ironers looked round. Sister Ann picked it up; rubbed it on the ironing cloth to
see that it was the right heat, put it on Sister Caroline's stand, and took away
the cool one.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact is this,&quot; she said, putting the latter to the fire, &quot;you can't make
pea-soup, Sister Caroline. Now, it's of no use to fly out: you <i>can't</i>. You
don't go the right way to make it. You just put on the liquor that the beef or
pork has been boiled in, or from bones stewed down, as may be, and you boil the
peas in that, and serve it up as pea-soup. Fine soup it is! No flavour, no
goodness, no anything. The stock is good enough: we can't afford better; and
nobody need have better: but if you want your pea-soup to be nice, you must stew
plenty of vegetables in it--carrots especially, and the outside leaves of
celery. That gives it a delicious flavour: and you need not use half the
quantity of peas if you pass the pulp of the vegetables with them through the
calender.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, yes!&quot; returned Sister Caroline in a sarcastic tone. &quot;<i>Your</i>
pea-soup is always good: we all know that!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And so it is good,&quot; was easy-tempered Sister Ann's cheery answer: and she
knew that she spoke the truth. &quot;The soup I make is not a tasteless stodge that
you may almost cut with the spoon, as the soup was to-day; but a delicious,
palatable soup that anybody may enjoy, fit for the company-table of the Master
of Greylands. Just look how your candle wants snuffing!&quot;</p>
<p>Sister Caroline snuffed the candle with a fling, and put down the snuffers.
She did not like to be found fault with. Sister Phoeby, who wanted a fresh iron,
went clanking to the fire in her pattens, and got it for herself, leaving her
own in the bars. Sister Ann was busy just then, turning the clothes on the
horse.</p>
<p>&quot;What I should do with that cold pea-soup is this--for I'm sure it can never
be eaten as it is,&quot; suggested Sister Ann to the cook. &quot;You've got the liquor
from that boiled knuckle of ham in the larder; put it on early to-morrow with
plenty of water and fresh vegetables; half an hour before dinner strain the
vegetables off, and turn the pea-soup into it. It will thin it by the one half,
and make it palatable.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's the time?&quot; demanded Sister Caroline, making no answering comment to
the advice. &quot;Does anybody know?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It must have struck half-past eight.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Was not Sister Margaret to have some arrowroot taken up?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I'll make it,&quot; said Sister Ann. &quot;You two keep on, with the ironing.&quot;</p>
<p>Sister Margaret was temporarily indisposed; the result, Mr. Parker thought,
of a chill; and was confined to her bed. Taking a small saucepan from its place,
Sister Ann was reaching in the cupboard for the tin of arrowroot, when a most
tremendous ringing came to the house bell. Whether it was one prolonged ring, or
a succession of rings, they could not tell; but it never ceased, and it alarmed
the Sisters. Cries and shrieks were also heard outside.</p>
<p>&quot;It must be fire!&quot; ejaculated the startled women.</p>
<p>All three rushed out of the kitchen and made for the front door, Sister
Phoeby kicking off her pattens that she might ran the quicker. Old Sister
Mildred, who had become so much better of late that she was about again just as
the other ladies were, appeared at the door of the parlour with Sister Mary
Ursula.</p>
<p>&quot;Make haste, children! make haste!&quot; she cried, as the three were fumbling at
the entrance-door, and impeding one another; for &quot;The more haste the less
speed,&quot; as says the old proverb, held good here.</p>
<p>When it was flung open, some prostrate body in a shawl and bonnet was
discovered there, uttering cries and dismal moans. The Sisters hastened to raise
her, and found it was Miss Hallet. Miss Hallet covered from head to foot in
dust. She staggered in, clinging to them all. Jane followed more sedately, but
looking white and scared.</p>
<p>&quot;Dear, dear!&quot; exclaimed compassionating Sister Mildred, whose deafness was
somewhat better with her improved health, so that she did not always need her
new ear-trumpet. &quot;Have you had an accident, Miss Hallet? Pray come into the
parlour.&quot;</p>
<p>Seated there in Sister Mildred's own easy-chair, her shawl unfastened by
sympathising hands, her bonnet removed, Miss. Hallet's gasps culminated in a fit
of hysterics. Between her cries she managed to disclose the truth--the Grey Monk
had appeared to her.</p>
<p>Some of the Sisters gave a shiver and drew closer together. The Grey Monk
again!</p>
<p>&quot;But all the dust that is upon you?&quot; asked Sister Phoeby. &quot;Did the Grey Friar
do that?&quot;</p>
<p>In one sense yes, for he had caused it, was the substance of Miss Hallet's
answer. The terror he gave her was so great that she had fallen flat down in the
dusty road.</p>
<p>In half a minute after Miss Hallet's shriek and fall, as related in the last
chapter, Jane had run up to her. The impression upon Miss Hallet's mind was that
Jane had come up from behind her, not from before her; but Jane seemed to
intimate that she had come back from Chapel Lane; and Miss Hallet's perceptions
were not in a state to be trusted just then. &quot;What brings you here, aunt?--what
are you doing up here?--what's the matter?&quot; asked Jane, essaying to raise her.
&quot;Nay,&quot; said Miss Hallet, when she could get some words out for fright, &quot;the
question is, what brings <i>you</i> here?&quot; &quot;I,&quot; said Jane; &quot;why I was only
running to the Hutt, to give Commodore Teague the muffetees I have been knitting
for him,&quot; and out of Jane's pocket came the said muffetees, of a bright
plum-colour, in proof of the assertion; though it might be true or it might not.
&quot;Has it gone?&quot; faintly asked Miss Hallet. &quot;Has what gone, aunt?&quot; &quot;The Grey
Friar. It appeared to me at that window, and down I fell: my limbs failed me.&quot;
&quot;There--there <i>is</i> a faint light,&quot; said Jane, looking up for the first
time. &quot;Oh, aunt!&quot; Jane's teeth began to chatter. Miss Hallet, in the extreme
sense of terror, and not daring to get up, took a roll or two down the hill in
the dust: anything to get away from that dreadful Keep. But it bumped and
bruised her: she was no longer young; not to speak of the damage to her clothes,
of which she was always careful. So with Jane's help she managed to get upon her
feet, and reach the Nunnery somehow; where, shrieking in very nervousness, she
seized upon the bell, and pulled it incessantly until admitted, as though her
arm were worked by steam.</p>
<p>&quot;My legs failed me,&quot; gasped Miss Hallet, explaining now to the Sisters: &quot;I
dropped like a stone in the road, and rolled there in the dust. It was an awful
sight,&quot; she added, drawing unconsciously on the terrors of her imagination: &quot;a
bluish, greenish kind of light at first; and then a most dreadful, ghostly
apparition with a lamp, or soft flame of some kind, in its outstretched arm. I
wonder I did not die.&quot;</p>
<p>Sister Mildred unlocked a cupboard, and produced a bottle of cordial, a
recent present from Mrs. Bent: a little of which she administered to the
terrified nervous woman. Miss Hallet swallowed it in gulps. There was no end of
confused chattering: a ghost is so exciting a subject to discuss, especially
when it has been just seen. Sister Ann compared the present description of the
Grey Friar with that which she and Sister Rachel had witnessed, not so long
before, and declared the two to tally in every particular. Trembling Sister
Judith added her personal testimony. Altogether there had not been so much noise
and bustle within the peaceful walls of the Nunnery since that same eventful
night, whose doings had been crowned by the arrival of poor little Polly Gleeson
with her burns. In the midst of it an idea occurred to Sister Mildred.</p>
<p>&quot;But what brought you up by the Friar's Keep at night, Miss Hallet?&quot; she
asked. &quot;It is a lonely road: nobody takes it by choice.&quot;</p>
<p>Miss Hallet made no answer. She was gasping again.</p>
<p>&quot;I dare say she was going to see the coastguardsman's wife, sick Emma Mann,&quot;
spoke Sister Phoeby heartily. &quot;Don't tease her.&quot; And Miss Hallet, catching at
the suggestion in her extremity, gave Sister Phoeby a nod of acquiescence. It
went against the grain to do so, for she was integrity itself, but she would not
have these ladies know the truth for the world.</p>
<p>&quot;And Jane had ran on to take the mittens to the Commodore, so that you were
alone,&quot; said Sister Mildred, following out probabilities in her own mind, and
nodding pleasantly to Miss Hallet. &quot;I see. Dear me! What a dreadful thing this
apparition is!--what will become of us all? I used not to believe in it much.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, you see people have gone past the Keep at night lately more than they
used to: I'm sure one or another seems always to be passing by it,&quot; remarked
Sister Ann sensibly. &quot;We should hear nothing about it now but for that.&quot;</p>
<p>When somewhat recovered, Miss Hallet asked for her bonnet and shawl: which
had been taken away to be shaken and brushed. Leaving her thanks with the
Sisters, she departed with Jane, and walked home in humility. Now than the
actual, present fear had subsided, she felt ashamed of herself for having given
way to it, and particularly for having disturbed the Nunnery in the frantic
manner described. But hers had been real, genuine terror; and she could no more
have helped its laying complete hold of her at the time than she could have
taken wings and flown away from the spot, as an arrow flies through the air. A
staid, sober-aged, well-reared woman like herself, to have made a commotion as
though she had been some poor ignorant fish girl! Miss Hallet walked dumbly
along, keeping her diminished head down as she toiled up the cliff.</p>
<p>After supper and prayers were over that night at the Nunnery, and most of the
Grey Ladies had retired to their rooms--which they generally did at an early
hour when there was nothing, sickness or else, to keep them up--Sisters Mildred
and Mary Ursula remained alone in the parlour. That they should be conversing
upon what had taken place was only natural. Mary Ursula had not, herself, the
slightest faith in the supernatural adjunct of the Grey Friar; who or what it
was she knew not, or why it should haunt the place and show itself as it did,
lamp in hand; but she believed it would turn out to be a real presence, not a
ghostly one. Sister Mildred prudently shook her head at this heterodoxy,
confessing that she could not join in it; but she readily agreed that the
Friar's Keep was a most mysterious place; and, in the ardour of conversation,
she disclosed a secret which very much astonished Mary Ursula. There was an
underground passage leading direct from the vaults of the Nunnery to the vaults
of the Keep.</p>
<p>&quot;I have known of it for many years,&quot; Mildred said, &quot;and never spoken of it to
any one. My Sister Mary discovered it: you have heard, I think, that she was one
of us in early days: but she died young. After we took possession of this
building, Mary, who was lively and active, used to go about, above ground and
under it, exploring, as she called it. One day she came upon a secret door
below, that disclosed a dark, narrow passage: she penetrated some distance into
it, but did not cate to go on alone. At night, when the rest of the ladies had
retired, she and I stayed up together--just as you and I have stayed up
to-night, my dear, for it was in this very parlour--and she got me to go and
explore it with her. We took a lantern to light our steps, and went. The passage
was narrow, as I have said, and apparently built in a long straight line,
without turnings, angles, or outlets. Not to fatigue you, I will shortly say,
that after going a very long way, as it seemed to us, poor timid creatures that
we were, we passed through another door, and found ourselves in a pillared place
that looked not unlike cloisters, and at length made it out to be vaults under
the Friar's Keep.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What a strange thing!&quot; exclaimed Mary Ursula, speaking into the instrument
she had recently made the good Sister a present of--a small ear-trumpet, for
they were talking almost in a whisper.</p>
<p>&quot;Not so strange when you remember what the place was originally,&quot; dissented
Sister Mildred. &quot;Tradition says, you know, that these old religions buildings
abounded in secret passages. I did not speak of the discovery, and enjoined
silence on Mary; the Sisters might have been uncomfortable; and it was not a
nice thing, you see, to let the public know there was a secret passage into our
abode.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did you never enter it again?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, once. Mary <i>would</i> go; and of course I could not let her go alone.
It was not long before the illness came on that terminated in her death. Ah, my
dear, we were young then, and such an expedition bore for us a kind of
pleasurable romance.&quot;</p>
<p>Mary Ursula sat in thought. &quot;It strikes me as not being a pleasant idea,&quot; she
said--&quot;the knowledge that we may be invaded at any hour by some ill-disposed or
curious straggler, who chooses to frequent the Friar's Keep.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not a bit of it, my dear,&quot; said Sister Mildred, briskly. &quot;Don't fear. We can
go to the Keep at will, but the Keep cannot come to us. The two doors are firmly
locked, and I hold the keys.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I should like to see this passage!&quot; exclaimed Mary Ursula. &quot;Are you--dear
Sister Mildred, do you think you are well enough to show it to me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll make myself well enough,&quot; returned the good-natured lady: &quot;and I think
I am really so. My dear, I have always meant from, the time you joined as to
tell you of this secret passage: and for two reasons. The one because the Head
of our Community ought not to be in ignorance that there is such a place; the
other because it was your cousin who recently has disappeared so unaccountably
in the Keep--though I suppose the passage could not have had anything to do with
that. But for my illness, I should have spoken before. We will go to-night, if
you will.&quot;</p>
<p>Mary Ursula eagerly embraced the proposal on the spot. Attiring themselves in
their warmest grey cloaks, the hoods well muffled about their heads, for Sister
Mildred said the passage would strike cold as an ice-house, they descended to
the vaults below; the elder lady carrying the keys and Mary Ursula the lighted
horn lantern, which had slides to its four sides to make it lighter or darker at
will.</p>
<p>&quot;See, here's the door,&quot; whispered Sister Mildred, advancing to an obscure
corner. &quot;No one would ever find it; unless they had a special talent for
exploring as my poor Mary had. Do you see this little nail in the wall? Well the
keys were hanging up there: and it was in consequence of the keys catching her
eye That Mary looked for the door.&quot;</p>
<p>It required the efforts of both ladies to turn the key in the rusty lock. As
the small gothic door was pushed open, a rash of cold damp air blew on their
faces. The passage was hardly wide enough to admit two abreast; at least without
brushing against the walls on either side. The ladies held one another; Mary
Ursula keeping a little in advance, her hand stretched upwards with the lantern
so that its light might guide their steps.</p>
<p>A very long passage: no diversion in it, no turnings or angles or outlets, as
Sister Mildred had described; nothing but the damp and monotonous stone walls on
either hand or overhead. While Mary Ursula was wondering whether they were going
on for ever, the glimmer of the lantern suddenly played on a gothic door in
front, of the same size and shape as the one they had passed through.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the other door, and this is the key,&quot; whispered Sister Mildred.</p>
<p>They put it in the lock. It turned with some difficulty and a grating sound,
and the door slowly opened towards them. Another minute, and they had passed
into the vaults beneath the Friar's Keep.</p>
<p>Very damp and cold and mouldy and unearthly. As far as Mary Ursula could
judge, in the dim and confined light emitted by the small lantern, they appeared
to be quite like the cloisters above: the same massive upright pillars of
division forming arches against the roof, the same damp stone flooring. There
was no outlet to be seen in any part; no staircase upwards or downwards. Mary
Ursula carried her lantern and waved it about but could find none: none save the
door they had come through.</p>
<p>&quot;Is there any outlet to this place, except the passage?&quot; she asked of Sister
Mildred.</p>
<p>&quot;Very, my dear; very damp indeed,&quot; was the Sister's answer. &quot;I think we had
better not stay; I am shivering with the cold air; and there's nothing, as you
perceive, to see.&quot;</p>
<p>The ear-trumpet had been left behind, and Mary Ursula did not dare raise her
voice to a loud key. She was inwardly shivering herself; not with the chilly,
mildewy air, but with her own involuntary thoughts. Thoughts that she would have
willingly forbidden entrance to, but could not. With these secret vaults and
places under the Keep, secret because they were not generally known abroad, what
facilities existed for dealing ill with Anthony Castlemaine; for putting him out
of sight for ever!</p>
<p>&quot;Can he be concealed here still, alive or dead?&quot; she murmured to herself.
&quot;Surely not alive: for how----&quot;</p>
<p>A sound! A sound close at hand. It was on the opposite side of the vault, and
was like the striking of some metal against the wall: or it might have been the
banging of a door. Instinctively Mary Ursula hid the lantern under her cloak,
caught hold of Sister Mildred, and crouched down with her behind the remotest
pillar. The Sister had heard nothing, of course; but she comprehended that there
was some cause for alarm.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, my dear, what will become of us!&quot; she breathed. &quot;Whatever is it?&quot;</p>
<p>Mary dared not speak. She put her hand on the Sister's lips to enjoin
silence, and kept it there. Sister Mildred had gone down in a most uncomfortable
position, one leg bent under her; and but for grasping the pillar for support
with both hands she must have tumbled backwards. Mary Ursula, was kneeling in
very close contact, which helped to prop the poor lady up behind. As to the
pillar, it was nothing like wide enough to conceal them both had the place been
light.</p>
<p>But it was pitch dark. A darkness that might almost be felt. In the midst of
it; in the midst of their painful suspense, not knowing what to expect or fear,
there arose a faint, distant glimmering of light over in the direction where
Mary had heard the sound. A minute afterwards some indistinct, shadowy form
appeared, dressed in a monk's habit and cowl. It was the apparition of the Grey
Friar.</p>
<p>A low, unearthly moan broke from Sister Mildred. Mary Ursula, herself faint
with terror, as must be confessed, but keenly alive to the necessity for their
keeping still and silent, pressed the Sister's mouth more closely, and strove to
reassure her by clasping her waist with the other hand. The figure, holding its
lamp before it, glided swiftly across the vault amid the pillars, and vanished.</p>
<p>It all seemed to pass in a single moment. The unfortunate ladies--&quot;distilled
almost to jelly with the effect of fear,&quot; as Horatio says--cowered together, not
knowing what was next to happen to them, or what other sight might appear.
Sister Mildred went into an ague-fit.</p>
<p>Nothing more came; neither sight nor sound. The vaulted cloisters remained
silent and inky-dark. Presently Mary Ursula ventured to show her light
cautiously to guide their footsteps to the door, towards which she supported
Sister Mildred: who once in the passage and the door locked behind her, gave
vent to her suppressed terror in low cries and moans and groans. The light of
the lantern, thrown on her face, showed it to be as damp as the wall on either
side her, and ghastly white. Thus they trod the passage back to their own
domains, Sister Mildred requiring substantial help.</p>
<p>&quot;Take the keys,&quot; she said to Mary Ursula, when they were once more in the
warm and lighted parlour, safe and sound, save for the fright. &quot;They belong to
your custody of right now; and I'm sure a saint out of heaven would never induce
me to use them again. I'd rather have seen a corpse walk about in its
grave-clothes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But, dear Sister Mildred--it was very terrifying, I admit; but it could not
have been supernatural. There cannot be such things as ghosts.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My child, we saw it,&quot; was the all-convincing answer &quot;Perhaps if they were to
get a parson into the place and let him say some prayers, the poor wandering
spirit might be laid to rest.&quot;</p>
<p>That there was something strangely unaccountable connected with the Friar's
Keep and some strange mystery attaching to it, Mary Ursula felt to her heart's
core. She carried the two keys to her chamber, and locked them up in a place of
safety. Her room adjoined Sister Mildred's; and she stood for some time looking
out to sea before undressing. Partly to recover her equanimity; which had
unquestionably been considerably shaken during the expedition; partly to indulge
her thoughts and fancies, there she stood. An idea of the possibility of Anthony
Castlemaine's being alive still, and kept a prisoner in some of these vaults
underneath the Keep, had dawned upon her. That there were other and more secret
vaults besides these cloisters they had seen, was more than probable: vaults in
which men might be secretly confined for a lifetime--ay, and no doubt had been
in the old days; confined until claimed by a lingering death. She did not think
it likely that Anthony was there, alive: the conviction, that he was dead, had
lain upon her from the first; it was upon her still: but the other idea had
crept in and was making itself just sufficiently heard to render her
uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Her chamber was rather a nice one and much larger than Sister Mildred's.
Certain articles suggestive of comfort, that had belonged to her room at
Stilborough, had been placed in it: a light sofa and sofa table; a pretty stand
for books; a handsome reading lamp; a small cabinet with glass doors, within
which were deposited some cherished ornaments and mementoes that it would have
given her pain to part with; and such like. If Miss Castlemaine had renounced
the world, she had not renounced some of its little vanities, its
home-refinements neither did the Community she had joined require anything of
the kind to be done. The window, with its most beautiful view of the sea, was
kept free; curtains and draperies had been put up, no less for warmth than look:
on one side it stood the cabinet, on the other the dressing-table and glass; the
bed and the articles of furniture pertaining to it, drawers, washhand-stand, and
such like, occupied the other end of the room. It was, in fact, a sitting-room
and bedroom combined. And there, at its window, stood Mary Ursula, shivering
almost as much as she had shivered in the cloisters, and full of inward
discomfort.</p>
<p>In the course of the following morning, she was sitting with sick Sister
Margaret, when word came to her that a gentleman had called. Proceeding to the
reception parlour, she found the faithful old friend and clerk, Thomas Hill. He
was much altered, that good old man: the unhappy death of his master and the
anxiety connected with the bank affairs had told upon him perhaps also the
cessation from the close routine of daily business was bearing for him its
almost inevitable effect: at least, when Mary Ursula tenderly asked what it was
that ailed him, he answered, Weariness, induced by having nothing to do. The
tears rushed to his eyes when he inquired after her life--whether it satisfied
her, whether she was not already sick to death of it, whether repentance for the
step had yet set in. And Mary assured him that the contrary was the fact; that
she was getting to like the seclusion better day by day.</p>
<p>&quot;Can you have comforts here, my dear Miss Mary?&quot; he inquired, not at all
satisfied.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, yes, any that I please,&quot; she replied. &quot;You should see my room above,
dear old friend: it is nearly as luxurious and quite as comfortable as my
chamber was at home.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Will they let you have a fire in it, Miss Mary?&quot;</p>
<p>She laughed; partly at the thought, partly to reassure him. &quot;Of course I
could if I wished for it; but the weather is coming in warm now. Sister Mildred
has had a fire in her room all the winter. I am head of all, you know, and can
order what I please.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you'll not forget, Miss Mary, that what I have is yours,&quot; he returned in
a low, eager tone. &quot;Draw upon it when you like: be sure to take care of your
comforts. I should like to leave you a cheque-book: I have brought it over with
its cheques signed----&quot;</p>
<p>She stopped him with hasty, loving words of thanks. Assuring him that her
income was enough, and more than enough, for everything she could possibly want,
whether individually or for her share in the expenses of the Community. Thomas
Hill, much disappointed, returned the new cheque-book to his pocket again.</p>
<p>&quot;I wish to ask you one question,&quot; she resumed, after a pause, and in a tone
as low as his own. &quot;Can you tell me how the estate of Greylands' Rest was left
by my grandfather?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, I cannot, Miss Mary; I have never known. Your father did not know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My father did not know?&quot; she said in some surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;He did not. On the very last day of his life, when he was just as ill as he
could be, my dear good master, he spoke of it to me: it was while he was giving
me a message to deliver to his nephew, the young man Anthony, Mr. Basil's son.
He said that he had never cared to inquire the particulars, and fully believed
that it became James's by legal right; he felt sure that had it been left to
Basil, James would not have retained possession. Miss Mary, I say the same.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And--what is your opinion as to what became of Anthony?&quot; she continued after
a short pause.</p>
<p>&quot;I think, my dear, that young Mr. Anthony must somehow have fallen into the
sea. He'd not be the first man, poor fellow, by a good many, who has met with
death through taking an uncertain step in the deceptive moonlight.&quot;</p>
<p>Mary Ursula said no more. This was but conjecture, just as all the rest of it
had been.</p>
<p>When the visit was over, she put on her bonnet to stroll out with him. He had
walked from Stilborough, intending to dine at the Dolphin, and go back
afterwards at his leisure. Mary went with him on the beach, and then parted with
him at the door of the inn.</p>
<p>&quot;You are sure you are tolerably happy, my dear?&quot; he urged, as though needing
to be assured of it again and again, holding both her hands in his. &quot;Ah, my dear
young lady, it is all very well for you to say you are; but I cannot get
reconciled to it. I wish you could have found your happiness in a different
sphere.&quot;</p>
<p>She knew what he meant--found it as William Blake-Gordon's wife--and
something like a faintness stole over her spirit.</p>
<p>&quot;Circumstances worked against it,&quot; she meekly breathed. &quot;I am content to
believe that the life I have embraced is the best for me; the one appointed by
God.&quot;</p>
<p>How little did she think that almost close upon that minute, she should
encounter <i>him</i>--her whilom lover! Not feeling inclined to return at once
to the Nunnery, and knowing that there was yet a small space of time before
dinner, she continued her way alone up the secluded road towards the church.
When just abreast of the sacred edifice a lady and gentleman approached on
horseback, having apparently ridden from Stilborough. She recognized them too
late to turn or retreat: it was William Blake-Gordon and Miss Mountsorrel.</p>
<p>Miss Mountsorrel checked her horse impulsively; he could but do the same. The
young lady spoke.</p>
<p>&quot;Mary! is it you? How strange that we should meet you! I thought you never
came beyond the convent walls.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did you? I go out where and when I please. Are you well, Agatha?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are <i>you</i> well?--that is the chief question,&quot; returned Miss
Mountsorrel, with a great deal of concern and sympathy in her tone. &quot;You do not
look so.&quot;</p>
<p>Just then Mary undoubtedly did not. Emotion had turned her as pale as death.
Happening to catch sight of the countenance of Mr. Blake-Gordon, she saw that
his face was, if possible, whiter than her own. A strangely yearning, imploring
look went out to her from his eyes--but what it meant, she knew not.</p>
<p>&quot;I shall come and see you some day, Mary, if I may,&quot; said Miss Mountsorrel.</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly you may.&quot;</p>
<p>They prepared to ride on: Mr. Blake-Gordon's horse was restive. The young
ladies wished each other good morning he bowed and lifted his hat. He had not
spoken a word to her, or she to him. They had simply stood there face to face,
he on horseback, she on foot, with the tale-telling emotion welling up from
their hearts.</p>
<p>Mary opened the churchyard gate, went in, and sat down under a remote tree
near the tomb of the Castlemaines, hiding her face in her hands. She felt sick
and faint; and trembled as the young green leaves about her were trembling in
the gentle wind. So! this was the manner of their meeting again: when he was
riding by the side of another!</p>
<p>The noise of horses, passing by, caused her to raise her head and glance to
the road again. Young Mountsorrel was riding swiftly past to catch his sister,
having apparently lingered temporarily behind: and the groom clattered closely
after him at a sharp trot.</p>

<h4><a name="div1_24" href="#div1Ref_24">CHAPTER XXIV.</a></h4>
<h5>GOING OVER IN THE TWO-HORSE VAN.</h5>
<br>

<p>August weather. For some few months had elapsed since the time of the last
chapter. Stilborough lay hot and dusty under the summer sun: the pavements shone
white and glistening, the roads were parched. Before the frontage of the Turk's
Head on the sunny side of Cross Street, was spread a thick layer of straw to
deaden the sound of horses and vehicles. A gentleman, driving into the town a
few days before, was taken ill there, and lay at the hotel in a dangerous state:
his doctor expressed it as &quot;between life and death.&quot; It was Squire Dobie, of
Dobie Hall.</p>
<p>The Turk's Head was one of those good, old-fashioned, quiet inns, not much
frequented by the general public, especially by the commercial public. Its
custom was chiefly confined to the county families, and to that class of people
called gentlefolk. It was, therefore, very rarely in a bustle, showing but
little signs of life except on Thursdays, market-day, and it would sometimes be
so empty that Stilborough might well wonder how Will Heyton, its many years
landlord, contrived to pay his expenses. But Will Heyton had, in point of fact,
made a very nice nest-egg at it, and did not much care now whether the inn was
empty or full.</p>
<p>In the coffee-room on this hot August morning, at a small table by the
right-hand window, sat a gentleman breakfasting. A tall, slender, well-dressed
young man in slight mourning, of perhaps some six-and-twenty years. He was
good-looking; with a pleasing, fair, and attractive face, blue eyes, and light
wavy hair that took a tinge of gold in the sunlight. This gentleman had arrived
at Stilborough the previous evening by a cross-country coach, had inquired for
the best hotel, and been directed to the Turk's Head. It was late for breakfast,
nearly eleven o'clock: and when the gentleman--whose name was inscribed on the
hotel visitors' list as Mr. George North--came down he had said something in a
particularly winning way about the goodness of the bed causing him to oversleep
himself. Save for him, the coffee-room was void of guests.</p>
<p>&quot;Is this a large town?&quot; he inquired of the portly head waiter, who was partly
attending on him, partly rubbing up the glasses and decanters that were ranged
on the mahogany stand by the wall.</p>
<p>&quot;Pretty well, sir. It's next in size to the chief county town, and is quite
as much frequented.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What are the names of the places near to it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We have no places of note near to us, sir: only a few small villages that
count for nothing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, what are their names?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There's Hamley, sir; and Eastwick; and Greylands; and----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are any of these places on the sea?&quot; interrupted the stranger, as he helped
himself to a mutton chop.</p>
<p>&quot;Greylands is, sir. It's a poor little place in itself, nothing hardly but
fishermen's huts in it; but the sea is beautiful there.--Bangalore sauce, sir?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I don't know,&quot; said the young man, looking first at the bottle of
sauce, being handed to him, and then up at the waiter, a laughing doubt in his
blue eyes. &quot;Is it good?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's very good indeed, sir, as sauce; and rare too; you'd not find it in any
other inn at Stilborough. Not but what some tastes prefer mutton chops plain.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think I do,&quot; said the stranger, declining the sauce. &quot;Thank you; it may be
better to let well alone.&quot;</p>
<p>His breakfast over, Mr. George North sat back in his chair, and glanced
through the sunbeams at the dusty road and the white pavement. The waiter placed
on the table the last number of the Stilborough Herald; and nearly at the same
moment there dashed up to the inn door a phaeton and pair. The gentleman who was
driving handed the reins to the groom sitting beside him, alighted, and entered
the hotel.</p>
<p>The sun, shining right in Mr. George North's eyes, had somewhat obscured his
view outwards; but as the gentleman came in and stood upright in the
coffee-room, he saw a tall stately man with a remarkably handsome face. While
gazing at the face, a slight emotion came suddenly into his own. &quot;What a
likeness!&quot; he inwardly murmured. &quot;Can it be one of them?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How is Squire Dobie, Hobbs?&quot; demanded Mr. Castlemaine of the old waiter--for
the new-comer was the Master of Greylands. &quot;Any better to-day?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, sir; the doctor thinks there's a slight improvement. He has had a
fairly good night.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's well. Is Mr. Atherly expected in to-day, do you know?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, I don't, sir. Perhaps master knows. I'll inquire.&quot;</p>
<p>While the waiter was gone on this errand, Mr. Castlemaine strolled to the
unoccupied window, and looked out on his waiting horses. Fine animals, somewhat
restive this morning, and the pride of Mr. Castlemaine's stables. He glanced at
the stranger, sitting at the not yet cleared breakfast table, and was taken at
once with his bright face and looks. Mr. George North was then reading the
newspaper. Hobbs did not return, and Mr. Castlemaine stamped a little with one
foot as though he were impatient. A sudden thought struck the young man: he
rose, and held out the newspaper.</p>
<p>&quot;I beg your pardon, sir; I am perhaps, keeping this from you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not at all, thank you,&quot; said Mr. Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;I am a stranger; therefore this local news cannot interest me,&quot; persisted
Mr. George North, fancying courtesy alone might have prompted the refusal. &quot;It
is of no moment whether I read the gazette or not.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have already seen it: I am obliged to you all the same,&quot; replied Mr.
Castlemaine in his pleasantest manner, with not a shade of hauteur about it.
&quot;Are you staying here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;At present I am. It may be that I shall stay but for a short while. I cannot
say yet. We artists travel about from village to village, from country to
country, finding subjects for our pencil. I have lately been in the Channel
Islands.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Master says he is not particularly expecting Mr. Atherly to-day, sir,&quot;
interposed Hobbs, returning; &quot;but he thinks it likely he may be coming in. He'll
get here about one o'clock if he does come.&quot;</p>
<p>The Master of Greylands nodded in reply. &quot;I suppose, Hobbs, Squire Dobie is
not allowed to see anyone?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not yet, sir.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Castlemaine left the room, saluting the stranger at the breakfast table.
Hobbs followed, to attend him to the door.</p>
<p>&quot;What's the name of the young man in the coffee-room?&quot; he asked, standing for
a moment on the steps. &quot;He seems to be a nice young fellow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;North, sir. Mr. George North. He came in last night by the Swallow coach.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He says he is an artist.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, does he, sir!&quot; returned the waiter in an accent of mingled surprise and
disappointment. &quot;I'm sure I took him to be a gentleman.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Castlemaine smiled to himself at the words. Hobbs' ideas, he thought,
were probably running on the artists who went about painting signboards.</p>
<p>&quot;That accounts for his wanting to know the names of the parts about here,&quot;
spoke the waiter. &quot;He has been asking me. Them artists, sir, are rare ones for
tramping about after bits of scenery.&quot;</p>
<p>The Master of Greylands went out to his carriage and took his seat. As he
turned the horses' heads round to go back the way they came, Mr. George North,
looking on from within, had for a moment the back of the phaeton pointed right
towards him, with its distinguishing crest.</p>
<p>&quot;The crest!&quot; he exclaimed, under his breath. &quot;Then it must be one of them!
And I nearly knew it by the face. Shall I ask here which of them it is?--no,
better not. Suppose I go out and take a look at the town?&quot; he continued a few
minutes later, waking up from a reverie.</p>
<p>Putting on his straw hat, which had a bit of black ribbon tied round it, and
a good-sized brim, he went strolling hither and thither. It was not market day:
but few people were abroad, and the streets looked almost deserted. People did
not care to come abroad in the blazing sun, unless obliged. Altogether, there
was not much for Mr. George North to see. Before an inn-door stood a kind of
small yellow van, or omnibus--it was in fact something between the two--which
was being laden to start. It made its journeys three times a week, and was
called the two-horse van.</p>
<p>For want of something better to look at, Mr. George North stood watching the
putting-to of the horses. On the sides of the van were inscribed the names of
the places it called at; amidst them was Greylands. His eyes rested on the name
and a sudden thought arose to him: Suppose I go over to Greylands by this yellow
omnibus!</p>
<p>&quot;Do you call at all these places to-day?&quot; he asked of a man, who was
evidently the driver.</p>
<p>&quot;At every one of 'em, sir. And come back here through 'em again to-morrow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Have I time to go as far as the Turk's Head and back before you start?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Plenty of time, sir. We are not particular to a few minutes either way.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. George North proceeded to the Turk's Head; not in the rather lazy fashion
to which his movements seemed by nature inclined, but as fast as the sun allowed
him. He there told the head waiter that he was going to make a little excursion
into the country for the purpose of looking about him, and might not be back
until evening, or even before the morrow.</p>
<p>&quot;Inside or outside, sir?&quot; questioned the driver when he got back.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, outside to-day. Can't I sit by you?&quot;</p>
<p>He was welcome, the driver said, the seat not being taken; and Mr. George
North mounted to the seat and put up his umbrella, which he had brought with him
as a shelter against the sun. Two or three more passengers got up behind, and
placed themselves amid the luggage; and there were several inside.</p>
<p>The two-horse van sped along very fairly; and in a short time reached the
first village. After descending a hill, the glorious sea burst into view.</p>
<p>&quot;What place do you call this?&quot; asked the stranger.</p>
<p>&quot;This is Greylands, sir.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Greylands, is it? I think I'll get down here. Dear me, what a beautiful sea!
How much do I pay you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A shilling fare, sir. Anything you please for the driver. Thank you, sir;
thank you,&quot; concluded the man pocketing the eighteen-pence given to him. &quot;We
shall stop in a minute, sir, at the Dolphin Inn.&quot;</p>
<p>On this hot day, which really seemed too hot for work, Mrs. Bent was stealing
a few moments' idleness on the bench outside her window. John had been sitting
there all the morning. The landlady was making free comments, after her wont,
upon the doings, good and bad, of her neighbours; John gave an answering remark
now and again, but she did not seem to wait for it.</p>
<p>There is not much to tell the reader of this short space of time that has
elapsed without record. No very striking event had taken place in it; Greylands
was much in the same condition as when we parted from it last. Poor Miss Hallet
had been ill for some weeks, possibly the result of the fright, and was quite
unable to look personally after the vagaries of Miss Jane: the Friar's Keep and
its mysteries remained where they had been; Sister Mildred was ill again, and
Mary Ursula had not plucked up courage since to penetrate anew the secret
passage. Squire Dobie, red-hot at first to unravel the mystery of the
disappearance of Basil's son, had finally given up the inquiry as hopeless;
neither had Madame Guise advanced one jot in her discoveries touching the
suspected iniquity of the Master of Greylands.</p>
<p>&quot;Here comes the two-horse van,&quot; remarked Mrs. Bent.</p>
<p>The two-horse van drew up before the bench and close to Mr. and Mrs. Bent.
Its way did not lie by that of the ordinary coach road, but straight on up the
hill past the Nunnery. Whether it had parcels or passengers to descend, or
whether it had not, it always halted at the Dolphin, to &quot;give the horses a
minute's breathing,&quot; as the driver said: and to give himself a minute's gossip
with the landlord and landlady.</p>
<p>The gossip to-day lay chiefly on the score of the unusual heat, and on some
refractory wheel of the van, which had persisted the previous day in dropping
its spokes out. And the driver had mounted to his seat again, and the van was
rattling off, before Mr. and Mrs. Bent remarked that the gentlemanly-looking man
in the straw hat, who had got down, as they supposed, merely to stretch his
legs, had not gone on with it.</p>
<p>He was standing with his back to them to look about him. At the pile of
buildings rising on his left, the Grey Nunnery; at the cliff towards the right,
with its nestling houses; at the dark-blue sea opposite, lying calm and lovely
under its stagnant fishing boats. A long, lingering look of admiration at the
latter, and he turned round to Mr. and Mrs. Bent, standing by the bench now, but
not sitting, and lifted his straw bat as he addressed them.</p>
<p>&quot;I beg your pardon. This seems to be a very nice place. What an expanse of
sea!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's a very nice place indeed--for its size, sir,&quot; said John. &quot;And you'd not
get a better sea than that anywhere.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The place is called Greylands, I am told.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, sir: Greylands.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am an artist,&quot; continued the stranger in his pleasing, open manner, a
manner that was quite fascinating both Mr. and Mrs. Bent. &quot;I should fancy there
must be choice bits of landscape about here well worth my taking.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And so there is, sir. Many of 'em.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Will you give me lodging for a few hours?--allow me to call your inn my
head-quarters, while I look about for myself a little?&quot; he continued with a most
winning smile.</p>
<p>&quot;And glad to receive you, sir,&quot; put in Mrs. Bent before her husband had time
to reply. &quot;Oar house is open to all, and especially to one as pleasant-speaking
as you, sir.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;By the way,&quot; he said, stopping to pause when stepping before them indoors,
as though he were trying to recall something--&quot;Greylands? Greylands? Yes, that
must be the name. Do you chance to know if a French lady is living anywhere in
this neighbourhood? A Madame Guise?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To be sure she is, sir. She is governess at Greylands Rest. Within a stone's
throw--as may almost be said--of this house.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, indeed. I knew her and her husband, Monsieur Guise, in France. He was my
very good friend. Dear me! how thirsty I am.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Would you like to take anything, sir?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I should; but not beer, or any strong drink of that sort. Have you any
lemonade?&quot;</p>
<p>John Bent had; and went to fetch it. The stranger sat down near the
open-window, and gazed across at the sea. Mrs. Bent was gazing at him; at his
very nice-looking face, so fair and bright, and at the wavy hair, light and fine
as silken threads of gold.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you English, sir?&quot; demanded free and curious Mrs. Bent.</p>
<p>&quot;Why do you ask the question?&quot; he returned with a smile, as he threw full on
her the light of his laughing blue eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, sir--though I'm sure you are an Englishman person--and a rare
good-looking one too--there's a tone in your voice that sounds foreign to me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am English,&quot; he replied: &quot;but I have lived very much abroad, in France and
Italy and other countries: have roamed about from place to place. No doubt my
accent has suffered. We can't be a vagabond, you see, madam, without betraying
it.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Bent shook her head at the epithet, which he spoke-with a laugh: few
persons, to judge by looks, were less of a vagabond than he. John came in with
the lemonade sparkling in a glass.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, that's good,&quot; said the traveller drinking it at a draught. &quot;If your
viands and wines generally are as good as that, Mr. Bent, your guests must be
fortunate. I should like to call and see Madame Guise,&quot; he added rising. &quot;I
suppose I may venture to do so?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why not, sir?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are the people she is with dragons?&quot; he asked, in his half laughing and
wholly fascinating way. &quot;Will they eat me up, think you? Some families do not
admit visitors to their governess.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You may call, and welcome, sir,&quot; said Mrs. Bent. &quot;The family are of note
hereabout, great gentlefolks--the Castlemaines. Madame Guise is made as
comfortable there as if it were her own house and home.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll venture then,&quot; said the stranger, taking his hat and umbrella. &quot;Perhaps
you will be good enough to direct the road to me.&quot;</p>
<p>John Bent took him out at the front door, and pointed out to him the way over
the fields--which were far pleasanter and somewhat nearer than the road way: and
Mr. North was soon at the gate of Greylands' Rest. Mrs. Castlemaine was seated
under a shady clump of trees, doing some wool work. He raised his hat and bowed
to her as he passed, but continued his way to the door. Miles opened it and
asked his pleasure.</p>
<p>&quot;I am told that Madame Guise lives here. May I be permitted to see her?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; replied the man, admitting him to the hall. &quot;What name?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. George North. I have not my cards with me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. George North!&quot; repeated Mrs. Castlemaine to herself, for she had been
near enough to hear distinctly the conversation in the stillness of the summer's
day. &quot;What an exceedingly handsome young man! Quite a Saxon face. I wonder who
he is!&quot;</p>
<p>Miles conducted Mr. George North to the red parlour, where Madame Guise was
sitting with Ethel. &quot;A gentleman to see you, ma'am,&quot; was his mode of
introduction: &quot;Mr. George North.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. ---- who!&quot; cried Madame, her manner hurried and startled.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. George North,&quot; repeated Miles; and ushered the gentleman in.</p>
<p>She turned her back upon the door, striving for courage and calmness in the
one brief moment of preparation that she might dare to snatch. But that Ethel's
attention was given to the stranger, she had not failed to see the agitation.
Madame's pocket-handkerchief was clutched almost through in her nervous hand.</p>
<p>&quot;How do you do, Madame Guise?&quot;</p>
<p>She turned round then, meeting him in the middle of the room. Her face was
white as death as she put out her hand to him. His own manner was unembarrassed,
but his countenance at the moment looked strangely grave.</p>
<p>&quot;Being in the neighbourhood I have ventured to call upon you, Madame Guise. I
hope you have been well.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Quite well, thank you,&quot; she said in a low tone, pointing to a chair, and
sitting down herself. &quot;I am so much surprised to see you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No doubt you are. How is the little girl?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She is at school with some good ladies, and she is quite happy there,&quot;
replied Madame Guise, speaking rather more freely. &quot;I thought you were in Italy,
Mr. North.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I left Italy some weeks ago. Since then I have been wandering onwards, from
place to place, sketching this, sketching that, in my usual rather vagabond
fashion, and have at length turned up in England.&quot;</p>
<p>The laughing light was coming back to his eyes again: he momentarily turned
them on Ethel as he spoke. Madame Guise seemed to consider she might be under an
obligation to introduce him.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. George North, my dear. Miss Ethel Reene, sir; one of my pupils.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. George North rose from his chair and bowed elaborately: Ethel bowed
slightly, smiled, and blushed. She was very much taken with the young man: and
perhaps, if the truth were known, he was with her. Certain it was, that she was
looking very pretty in her summer dress of white muslin, with the silver-grey
ribbons in her hair.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you come straight to England from Italy?&quot; asked Madame Guise.</p>
<p>&quot;My fashion of coming was not straight but very crooked,&quot; he answered. &quot;I
took the Channel Islands in my way.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Channel Islands!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Jersey and Guernsey and Sark. Though I am not quite sure how I got there,&quot;
he added in his very charming manner, and with another glance and half smile at
Ethel; who blushed again vividly as she met it, and for no earthly reason.</p>
<p>&quot;But you could not fly over to them in your sleep,&quot; debated Madame Guise,
taking his words literally.</p>
<p>&quot;I suppose not. I was at St. Malo one day, and I presume I must have gone
from thence in a boat. One of these days, when my fortune's made, I intend to
take up my abode for a few months at Sark. The climate is lovely; the scenery
beautiful.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How did you know I was here?&quot; asked Madame Guise.</p>
<p>&quot;I saw--I saw Madame de Rhone in France,&quot; he replied, making a slight break,
as put. &quot;She told me you had come to England and were living with an English
family at a place called Greylands,&quot; he continued. &quot;Finding myself to-day at
Greylands, I could but try to find you out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are very good,&quot; murmured Madame, whose hands were again beginning to
show signs of trembling.</p>
<p>Ethel rose to leave the room. It occurred to her that Madame might like to be
alone with her friend, and she had stayed long enough for good manners. At that
same moment, however, Mrs. Castlemaine came in by the open glassdoors, so
Ethel's considerate thought was foiled. Mrs. Castlemaine bowed slightly as she
looked at the stranger.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. North, madam; a friend of my late husband's,&quot; spoke Madame Guise, quite
unable to prevent her voice from betraying agitation. &quot;He was at Greylands
to-day and has found me out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We are very pleased to see Mr. North,&quot; said Mrs. Castlemaine, turning to him
with her most gracious tones, for the good looks and easy manners of the
stranger had favourably impressed her. &quot;Are you staying at Greylands?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;.I am travelling about, madam, from place to place, taking sketches. I have
recently come from Hampshire previous to that, I was in the Channel Islands.
Last night I slept at Stilborough, and came to Greylands this morning by a
conveyance that I heard called the 'two-horse van' in search of objects for my
pencil.&quot;</p>
<p>He mentioned the &quot;two-horse van&quot; so quaintly that Mrs. Castlemaine burst into
a laugh. &quot;I think you must have been jolted,&quot; she said, and Mr. North bowed.</p>
<p>&quot;Remembering to have been told that Madame Guise, the wife of my late dear
friend, Monsieur Guise was residing with a family at a place called Greylands, I
made inquiries for the address at the inn here, and presumed to call.&quot;</p>
<p>He bowed again slightly with somewhat of deprecation to Mrs. Castlemaine as
he spoke. She assured him he was quite welcome; that it was no presumption.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you an artist by profession, Mr. North?--Or do you take sketches for
pleasure?&quot; she asked presently, as the conversation proceeded.</p>
<p>&quot;Something of both, madam. I cannot say that I am dependent on my pencil. I
once painted what my friends were pleased to call a good picture, and it was
exhibited and bought--in Paris.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A watercolour?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, a watercolour.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I hope you got a good price for it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Five thousand francs.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How much is that in English money?&quot; asked Mrs. Castlemaine, after an
electrified pause, for at the first moment her ideas had run to five thousand
pounds.</p>
<p>&quot;Two hundred pounds. It was a scene taken in the Alpes-Maritimes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You have been much abroad, Mr. North?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, very much. I have latterly been staying for more than a year in Italy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How you must have enjoyed it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;For the time of sojourn I did. But it will always lay on my mind in a heavy
weight of repentance.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But why?&quot; exclaimed Mrs. Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;Because----&quot; and there he made a pause. &quot;In my unpardonable thoughtlessness,
madam, I, roving about from spot to spot, omitted sometimes to give any family
any address where news from them might find me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you had cause to repent not doing it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bitter cause,&quot; he answered, a <i>wrung</i> expression resting for an instant
on his face. &quot;My father died during that time; and--there were other matters
wanting me. My life, so far as that past portion of it goes, will be one of
unavailing repentance.&quot;</p>
<p>It almost seemed--at least the fancy struck Ethel--that Mr. North gave this
little bit of unusual confidence--unusual in a stranger--for the benefit of
Madame Guise. Certain it was, that he looked at her two or three times as he
spoke; and on her face there shone a strangely sad and regretful light.</p>
<p>In about half an hour he rose to depart. Mrs. Castlemaine offered luncheon,
but he declined it. He had been a lazy lie-abed that morning, he said with a
laughing smile, and it seemed but now almost that he had taken his breakfast at
the Turk's Head. The impression he left behind him was not so much of a
stranger, as of an acquaintance they had known, so pleasant and easy had been
the intercourse during the interview; and an acquaintance they were sorry to
part with.</p>
<p>Madame Guise went with him across the lawn. Mrs. Castlemaine would have gone
too, but that Ethel stopped her.</p>
<p>&quot;Mamma, don't,&quot; she whispered: &quot;they may be glad to have a few moments alone.
I fancy Madame Guise cannot have seen him since before her husband died: she
seemed quite agitated when he came in.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;True,&quot; said Mrs. Castlemaine, for once recognising reason in words of
Ethel's. &quot;What a gentlemanly young fellow he seems--in spite of that wide straw
hat.&quot;</p>
<p>He had put the straw hat on, and seemed to be looking at the different flower
beds in his progress; Madame Guise pointing to one and another with her finger.
Had Mrs. Castlemaine caught but a word of the private conversation being carried
on under the semblance of admiring the flowers, she might have stolen out to
listen in the gratification of her curiosity. Which would not have served her,
for they spoke in French.</p>
<p>&quot;How you startled me, George!&quot; cried Madame Guise, as their heads were both
bent over a rose-tree. &quot;I thought I should have fainted. It might have made me
discover all. Let us walk on!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I suppose I ought to have written first. But I thought I should be
introduced to you alone--your being here as the governess.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How are they all at Gap?--Look at these carnations.--How is Emma? Did you
get my letter through her?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I got it when I reached Gap. They are all well. She gave me your letter and
what news she could. I cannot understand it, Charlotte. <i>Where</i> is
Anthony?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dead. Murdered. As I truly and fully believe.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. North lifted his hat and passed his white handkerchief across his brow,
very perplexed and stern just then.</p>
<p>&quot;When can I see you alone, Charlotte?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This evening. As soon as dusk sets in, I will meet you in Chapel Lane:&quot; and
she directed him where to find it. &quot;You stay at the lower end near that great
building almost in ruins, the Friar's Keep, and I will come to you. Are you here
at last to help me unravel the treachery, George?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I will try to do it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But why have you been so tardy?--why did you go to--what did you say--those
Channel Islands?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I had an artist friend with me who <i>would</i> go over there. I did not
care to show too much eagerness to come on to England--he might have suspected I
had a motive. And it seems to me, Charlotte, that this investigation will be a
most delicate business; one that a breath of suspicion, as to who I am, might
defeat.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And oh, why did you linger so long in Italy, George?&quot; she asked in a low
tone of painful wailing. &quot;And to have neglected for months to let us get an
address that would certainly find you! Had you been at Gap when the father died,
the probability is that Anthony and you would have made the journey here in
company. Surely Mr. James Castlemaine had not dared to kill him then!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hush!&quot; he answered in a voice more bitterly painful than her own. &quot;You heard
what I said just now in the salon: the regret, the self-reproach will only cease
with my life. Until this evening then, Charlotte!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Until this evening.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who is that charming demoiselle?&quot; he asked, as they shook hands in parting.
&quot;What relation is she to the house?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No real relation of it at all. She is Miss Reene; Mrs. Castlemaine's
stepdaughter. Mrs. Castlemaine was a widow when she married into the family.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. George North closed the gate behind him; took off his hat to Madame with
the peculiar action of a Frenchman, and walked away.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h4><a name="div1_25" href="#div1Ref_25">CHAPTER XXV.</a></h4>
<h5>MR. GEORGE NORTH.</h5>
<br>

<p>If there existed one man eminently open by nature, more truthful, devoid of
guile, and less capable of deceit than his fellows, it was certainly George
North. And yet he was acting a deceitful part now; inasmuch as that he had made
his appearance in England and introduced himself at Greylands' Rest, under what
might be called a partially false name. For the name &quot;George North&quot; had but been
given him in baptism: the other, the chief one, was Castlemaine. He was the son
of Basil Castlemaine, and the younger brother of the most unfortunate Anthony.</p>
<p>Four children had been born to Basil Castlemaine and his wife. They were
named as follows: Anthony, Mary Ursula, George North, and Emma. The elder
daughter died young: the wife died just as her other children had grown up.
Anthony married Charlotte Guise; Emma married Monsieur de Rhone, a gentleman who
was now the chief partner in the Silk Mills, with which Basil Castlemaine had
been connected. The two young Castlemaines, Anthony and George, had both
declined to engage in commerce. Their father pointed to them that a share in the
Silk Mills was open to each, and no doubt a good fortune at the end of a few
years' connection with the business; beyond that, he did not particularly urge
the step on either of them. His sons would both inherit a modest competency
under his will. Anthony would also succeed (as Basil fully believed) to his
forefather's patrimony in England, Greylands' Rest, which would necessitate his
residence there; and George, at the age of twenty-four, came into a fairly good
fortune left to him by his uncle and godfather, Mr. North. Therefore, both of
them were considered by the father to be provided for, and if they preferred to
eschew commerce, they were welcome to do so. George had shown very considerable
talent for drawing and painting; it had been well cultivated; and though he did
not intend to make it exactly his profession, for he needed it not, he did hope
to become famous as a watercolour painter. Some time after attaining the age of
twenty-four, and taking possession of his bequeathed fortune, he had resolved on
making a lengthened sojourn in Italy; not to stay in one part of it, but to move
about as inclination dictated. And this he did.</p>
<p>From time to time he wrote home, saying where he then was; but rarely where
he would be later, simply because he did not know himself. Two or three letters
reached him in return, containing the information that all was well.</p>
<p>All being well seems to the young to mean always to be well; as it did to
George Castlemaine: his mind was at rest, and for several months there ensued a
gap of silence. It is true he wrote home; but, as to tidings from home reaching
him in return, he did not afford a chance for it. He crossed to Sicily, to
Corsica; he went to the Ionian Isles: it is hard to say where he did not go.
When tidings from home at length reached him, he found that his family, whom he
had been picturing as unchanged and happy, was totally dispersed. His father was
dead. Anthony had gone over to England to see after his patrimony; and, not
returning as he ought to have done, his wife and child had followed him. Emma de
Rhone, who conveyed all this in writing, to her brother, confessed she did not
understand what could have become of Anthony; but that she did not think he
could have lost himself, though of course England was a large place, and he,
being strange, might have a difficulty in making his way about it. To this
portion of the letter George gave no heed; at a happier time he would have
laughed at the notion of Anthony's being lost; his whole heart was absorbed in
the grief for his father and in self-reproach for his own supine carelessness.</p>
<p>He did not hurry home: there was nothing to go for now: and it was summer
weather when George once more re-entered Gap. To his intense astonishment, his
concern, his perplexity, he found that Anthony really was lost: at least, that
his wife seemed nimble to discover traces of him. Emma de Rhone handed him a
thick letter of several sheets, which had come enclosed to her for him from
Charlotte many weeks before, and had been waiting for him. When George
Castlemaine broke the seal, he found it to contain a detailed account of
Anthony's disappearance and the circumstances connected with it, together with
her suspicions of James Castlemaine, and her residence in that gentleman's
house. In short, she told him all; and she begged him to come over and see into
it for himself; but to come as a stranger, en cachette, and not to declare
himself to be connected with her, or as a Castlemaine. She also warned him not
to tell Emma or M. de Rhone of her worst fears about Anthony, lest they should
be undertaking the investigation themselves: which might ruin all hopes of
discovery, for Mr. Castlemaine was not one to be approached in that way. And the
result of this was that George Castlemaine was now here as George North. He had
deemed it well to obey Charlotte's behest, and come; at the same time he did not
put great faith in the tale. It puzzled him extremely: and he could but recall
that his brother's wife was given to be a little fanciful--romantic, in short.</p>
<p>Not a breath of air was stirring. The summer night seemed well-nigh as hot as
the day had been. There lay a mist on the fields behind the hedge on either side
Chapel Lane as Charlotte Guise hastened lightly down it. In her impatience she
had come out full early to keep the appointment, and when she reached the end of
the lane, George North--as for convenience' sake we must continue to call
him--was but then approaching it.</p>
<p>&quot;You found it readily, George?&quot; she whispered. &quot;Quite so. It is in a straight
line from the inn.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are you going back to Stilborough to-night?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No. I shall sleep at the Dolphin, and go back to-morrow.&quot;</p>
<p>He offered his sister-in-law his arm. She took it; but the next moment
relinquished it again. &quot;It may be better not, George,&quot; she said. &quot;It is not very
likely that we shall meet people, but it's not impossible: and, to see me
walking thus familiarly with a stranger would excite comment.&quot;</p>
<p>They turned to go up the hill. It was safer than Chapel Lane, as Charlotte
observed; for there was no knowing but Mr. Harry Castlemaine might be going
through the lane to the Commodore's, whose company both father and son seemed to
favour. Mr. Castlemaine was at Stilborough: had driven over in the morning, and
was no doubt staying there to dine.</p>
<p>&quot;This seems to be a lonely road,&quot; remarked Mr. North, as they went on side by
side.</p>
<p>&quot;It is very lonely. We rarely meet any one but the preventive-men: and not
often even one of them.&quot;</p>
<p>Almost in silence they continued their way until opposite the
coastguard-station: a short line of white dwellings lying at right angles with
the road on the left hand. Turning off to the right, across the waste land on
the other side the road, they soon were on the edge of the cliff, with the sea
lying below.</p>
<p>&quot;We may walk and talk here in safety,&quot; said Charlotte. &quot;There is never more
than one man on duty: his beat is a long one, all down there&quot;--pointing along
the line of coast in the opposite direction to that of Greylands--&quot;and we shall
see him, should he approach, long before he could reach us. Besides, they are
harmless and unsuspicious, these coastguardsmen; they only look out for ships
and smugglers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We do not get a very good view of the sea from here: that high cliff on the
right is an impediment,&quot; remarked Mr. North. &quot;What a height it is!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It shoots up suddenly, close on this side the Friar's Keep, and shoots down
nearly as suddenly to where we are now. Ethel Reene climbs it occasionally, and
sits there; but I think nobody else does.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not the preventive-men?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;By day sometimes. Never by night; it would be too dangerous. Their beat
commences here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And now, Charlotte, about this most unhappy business?&quot; said Mr. North, as
they began to pace backwards and forwards on the green brow of the coast, level
there. &quot;Where are we to look for Anthony? It cannot be that he is <i>lost</i>.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But he is lost, George. He went into the Friar's Keep that unhappy night in
February; and he was never seen to come out again. He never did come out again,
as most people here believe; I, for one. What other word is there for it but <i>
lost?</i>&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It sounds like a fable,&quot; said George North. &quot;Like a tale out of those
romance books you used to read, Charlotte.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I thought so when I came here first and heard it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did that account you sent me contain all the details?</p>
<p>&quot;I think it did. One cannot give quite so elaborate a history in writing a
letter as by word of mouth. Little particulars are apt to be dropped out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You had better go over it to me now, Charlotte: all you know from the
beginning. Omit not the smallest detail.&quot;</p>
<p>Madame Guise obeyed at once. The opening her mouth to impart this dreadful
story, dreadful and more dreadful to her day by day, was something like the
relief afforded to a parched traveller in an African desert, when he comes upon
the well of water he has been fainting for, and slakes his thirst. Not to one
single human being had Charlotte Guise been able to pour forth by word of mouth
this strange story all through these months since she heard it: the need to do
it, the pain, the yearning for sympathy and counsel, had been consuming her all
the while as with a fever heat.</p>
<p>She told the whole. The arrival of Anthony at the Dolphin Inn, and his
presenting himself to his family--as heard from John Bent. The ill-reception of
him by Mr. Castlemaine when he spoke of a claim to Greylands' Rest; the refusal
of Mr. Castlemaine to see him subsequently, and their hostile encounter in the
field; the strolling out by moonlight that same night of Anthony and the
landlord; their watching (quite by chance) the entrance of Mr. Castlemaine into
the Friar's Keep, and the hasty following in of Anthony, to have it out, as he
impulsively said, under the moonbeams; and the total disappearance of Anthony
from that hour. She told all in detail, George North listening without
interruption.</p>
<p>&quot;And it is supposed that the cry, following on the shot that was almost
immediately heard, was my poor brother's cry?&quot; spoke George, the first words
with which he broke the silence.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel sure it was his cry, George.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And Mr. James Castlemaine denies that he was there?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He denies it entirely. He says he was at home at the time and in bed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Suppose that it was Anthony who cried; that he was killed by the shot: would
it be easy to throw him into the sea out of sight?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not from the Keep. They say there is no opening to the sea. Mr. Castlemaine
may have dragged him across the chapel ruins and filing him from thence.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But could he have done that without being seen? John Bent, you say, was
outside the gates, waiting for Anthony.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But John Bent was not there all the time. When he got tired of waiting he
went home, thinking Anthony might have come out without his seeing him--but not
in his heart believing it possible that he had. Finding Anthony had not returned
to the inn, John Bent went again and searched the Keep with Mr. Nettleby, the
superintendent of these coastguardsmen.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And they did not find any trace of him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not any.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Or of any struggle, or other ill work?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I believe not. Oh, it is most strange!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who locked the gate--as you describe: and then opened it again?&quot; questioned
Mr. North after a moment's pause.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, I know not. Nobody can conjecture.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Have you searched well in this Keep yourself?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, George, I have not dared to do it! It has a revenant.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A <i>what!</i>&quot; exclaimed Mr. North.</p>
<p>&quot;A revenant. I have seen it, and was nearly frightened to death.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Charlotte!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know you strong men ridicule such things,&quot; said poor Madame Guise, meekly.
&quot;Anthony would have laughed just as you do. It's true, though. The Friar's Keep
is haunted by a dead monk: he appears dressed in his cowl and grey habit, the
same that he used to wear in life. He passes the window sometimes with a lamp in
his hand.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Since when has this revenant taken to appear?&quot; inquired George North, after
a short period of reflection. &quot;Since Anthony's disappearance?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, for a long, long while before it. I believe the monk died something like
two hundred years ago. Why? Were you thinking, George, that it might be the
revenant of poor Anthony?&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. George North drew in his disbelieving lips. At a moment like the present
he would not increase her pain by showing his mockery of revenants.</p>
<p>&quot;What I was thinking was this, Charlotte. Whether, if poor Anthony be really
no more, his destroyers may have cause to wish the Friar's Keep to remain
unexplored, lest traces of him might be found, and so have improvised a
revenant, as you call it, to scare people away.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The revenant has haunted the place for years and years, George. It has been
often seen.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then that puts an end to my theory.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I might have had courage to search the Keep by day for the dead, as we all
believe, do not come abroad then--but that I have not dared to risk being seen
there,&quot; resumed Madame Guise. &quot;Were I to be seen going into the Friar's Keep, a
place that every one shuns, it might be suspected that I had a motive, and Mr.
Castlemaine would question me. Besides, my young pupil is mostly with me by day:
it is only in the evening that I have unquestioned liberty.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wonder you reconciled yourself to go into the house as governess,
Charlotte.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;For Anthony's sake,&quot; she said imploringly. &quot;What would I not do for his
sake? And then, you see, George, while Anthony does not come forward to give
orders at Gap, and there is no proof that he is dead, I cannot draw money. My
own income is but small.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, my dear Charlotte, what are you talking of? You could have had any
amount of money you pleased from me. I----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You forget, George: you were travelling, and could not be written to.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, there was Emma,&quot; returned Mr. George, half confounded when thus
confuted by his own sins.</p>
<p>&quot;I did not want to give too much confidence to Emma and her husband: I have
told you why. And I would have gone into Mr. Castlemaine's house, George, the
opportunity offering, though I had been the richest woman in the world. But for
being there, I should not have known that Mr. Castlemaine holds secret
possession of Anthony's diamond ring. <i>You</i> remember that ring, George.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I remember I used jokingly to say I would steal it from him--it was so
beautiful. The possession of the ring is the most damaging proof of all against
my Uncle James. And yet not a certain proof.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not a certain proof!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No: for it is possible that he may have picked it up in the Friar's Keep.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then why should he not have shown the ring? An innocent man would have done
so at once, and--here comes the preventive-man,&quot; broke off Madame Guise, her
quick sight detecting the officer at some distance. &quot;Let us go down the bill
again, George.&quot;</p>
<p>They crossed the waste land to the road, and went towards the hill. George
North was lost in thought.</p>
<p>&quot;There is something about it almost incomprehensible,&quot; he said aloud: &quot;and
for my own part, Charlotte, I must avow that I cannot yet believe the Uncle
James to be guilty. The Castlemaines are recognised in their own land here as
mirrors of honour. I have heard my father say so many a time. And this is so
dreadful a crime to suspect anybody of! I think I saw the uncle to-day.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where?&quot; she asked. And Mr. North explained the appearance of the gentleman
that morning at the Turk's Head, whose carriage bore the Castlemaine crest. &quot;Oh,
yes, that was Mr. Castlemaine,&quot; she said, recognising him by the description.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, he does not look like a man who would do a dreadful deed, Charlotte.
He has a very attractive, handsome face: and I think a good face. Shall I tell
you why I have more particularly faith in his innocence?--Because he is so like
my father.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And I have never doubted his guilt. You must admit, George, that appearances
are strongly against him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Undoubtedly they are. And a sad thing it is to have to say it of one of the
family. Do you see much of the younger brother--the Uncle Peter?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But he is dead,&quot; returned Charlotte.</p>
<p>&quot;The Uncle Peter dead!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He died the very night that Anthony was lost: the mourning you saw Mrs.
Castlemaine wearing was for him; Ethel and the little girl have gone into
slighter mourning. And Madame Guise proceeded to give a brief history of Mr.
Peter Castlemaine's death and the circumstances surrounding it, with the
entrance of Mary Ursula to the Grey Nunnery. He listened in silence; just
remarking that he had wondered in the morning which of his two uncles it was
that he saw, and had felt half inclined to inquire of the waiter, but prudence
kept him from it.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the Friar's Keep,&quot; she said as they came to it, and her voice
instinctively took a tone of awe. &quot;Do you see those two middle windows, George?
It is within them that people see the revenant of the Grey Monk.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wish he would show himself now!&quot; heartily spoke George, throwing his eyes
on the windows. At which wish his sister-in-law drew close enough to touch him.</p>
<p>&quot;Here's the gate,&quot; she said, halting as they came to it. &quot;Was it not a <i>
strange</i> thing, George, that it should be locked that night!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If it really was locked; and is never locked at other times,&quot; replied George
North, who quite seemed, what with one implied doubt and another, to be going in
for some of the scepticism of his uncle, the Master of Greylands. Opening the
gate, he walked in. Charlotte followed. They looked inside the Gothic door to
the dark still cloisters of the Keep; they stood for some moments gazing out
over the sea, so expansive to the eye from this place: but Charlotte did not
care to linger there with him, lest they should be seen.</p>
<p>&quot;And it was to this place of ruins Anthony came, and passed into those
unearthly-looking cloisters!&quot; he exclaimed as they were going out. &quot;That dark,
still enceinte put me in mind of nothing so much as a dead-house.&quot;</p>
<p>Charlotte shivered. &quot;It is there,&quot; she said, &quot;that we must search for traces
of Anthony----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I suppose there is a staircase, or something of that kind, that leads to the
upper rooms of the Keep?&quot; he interrupted.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, yes: a stone staircase.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Have you been up to the rooms?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I!&quot; she exclaimed, as if he might have spared the question. &quot;Why, it is in
those upper rooms that the revenant is seen. Part of them are in ruins. Mr.
Castlemaine and some men of the law he called to his aid from Stilborough went
over it all after Anthony's loss, and found no traces of him. But what I think
is this, George: that a search conducted by Mr. Castlemaine would not be a
minute or true one: the Master of Greylands' will is law in the place: he is
bowed down to like a king. How shall you manage to account plausibly for taking
up your abode at Greylands, so that no suspicion may attach to you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I shall be here for the purpose of sketching, you understand. An obscure
travelling artist excites neither notice nor suspicion, Charlotte,&quot; he added in
a half-laughing tone. &quot;By the way--there's no danger, I hope, that the little
one, Marie Greylands, will remember Uncle George?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not the least; not the slightest. You left her too long ago for that. But,
take you notice, George, that here she is only Marie. It would not do to let her
other name, Greylands, slip out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I will take care,&quot; replied George North.</p>
<p>&quot;I think you Will. I think you have altered, George. You are more thoughtful
in mood, more sober in manner than you used to be.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; he answered. &quot;That carelessness and its sad fruits altered me,
Charlotte. It left me a lesson that will last me my lifetime.&quot;</p>
<p>They were opposite the entrance of the Grey Nunnery: and, in the selfsame
moment, its doors opened and Ethel Reene came forth, attended by Sister Ann. The
sight seemed to startle Madame Guise.</p>
<p>&quot;Dear me!--but it is I who am careless to-night,&quot; she said, below her breath.
&quot;Talking with you, George, has made me forget all; even time.&quot;</p>
<p>In fact, Madame was to have called at the Nunnery quite an hour ago for
Ethel: who had been to spend the evening there with Miss Castlemaine. Madame
went forward with her apologies: saying that she had met her husband's old
friend, Mr. North, and had stayed talking with him of by-gone days, forgetful of
the passing moments.</p>
<p>&quot;I will take charge of Miss Reene now, Sister Ann; I am so sorry you should
have to put your things on,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>&quot;Nay, but I am not sorry,&quot; returned Sister Ann candidly. &quot;It is pleasant to
us to get the change of a walk. Your little one has been very happy this
evening, Madame Guise; playing at bo-peep and eating the grapes Miss Reene
brought her.&quot;</p>
<p>Sister Ann retired indoors. Madame Guise and Ethel took the front way round
by the Dolphin to Greylands' Rest, Mr. George North attending them. The shortest
way was across the field path; though it involved a stile, Madame took it. Mr.
North talked to Ethel, and made himself very agreeable--as none could do better
than he: and Miss Ethel rejoiced that it was night instead of day, for she found
herself blushing repeatedly at nothing, just as she had done during his visit in
the morning. What could have come to her? she mentally asked; she had never been
absurd before: and she felt quite angry with herself. The conversation was held
in French, Madame having unconsciously resumed that language with Mr. North when
they left Sister Ann.</p>
<p>&quot;There are many delightful bits of scenery in this little place,&quot; said Mr.
North: &quot;I have been looking about me this afternoon. Perhaps I may bring myself
and my pencils here for a short sojourn: I should much like to take some
sketches.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, they are very nice views,&quot; said Ethel, blushing again. She was walking
arm in arm with the governess, and Mr. North strolled along at Ethel's elbow.</p>
<p>&quot;How very well you speak French!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Almost as well as we French
people ourselves. There's but a slight accent.&quot;</p>
<p>A deeper and quite unnecessary blush at this. &quot;But I thought you were
English, monsieur.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, so I am, mademoiselle. But when you come to sojourn a long while in a
country, you get to identify yourself with its inhabitants,--that is to say,
with their nationality.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you have been for a long time in France?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>They had come to the stile now. Mr. North got over it and assisted Madame
Guise. Ethel mounted instantly, and was jumping down alone: but he turned and
caught her. In the hurry she tripped, and somewhat crushed her hat against his
shoulder. He made fifty thousand apologies, just as though it had been his
fault; and there was much laughing. Mr. North quite forgot to release her hand
until they had gone on some paces; and Ethel's blush at this was as hot as the
summer's night.</p>
<p>At the entrance gate, where he had taken leave of Madame Guise in the
morning, he took leave of them now; shaking the hand of Madame and asking
whether he might be permitted to shake Ethel's, as it was the mode in England.
The blushes were worst of all then: and Ethel's private conviction was that the
whole world had never contained so attractive an individual as Mr. George North.</p>
<p>Mr. George North had all but regained the door of the Dolphin Inn, where he
had dined and would lodge for the night, when a carriage and pair, with its
bright lamps lighted, came spanking round the corner at a quick pace, the groom
driving. George North, drawing aside as it passed him, recognized the handsome
phaeton he had seen in the morning at the Turk's Head. The Master of Greylands
was returning from Stilborough.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h4><a name="div1_26" href="#div1Ref_26">CHAPTER XXVI.</a></h4>
<h5>DINING AT GREYLANDS' REST.</h5>
<br>

<p>It was yet early morning. The sky was darkly blue, the sea indolent and calm,
the air intensely hot. Mr. George North, sitting on the bench outside the
Dolphin Inn, his straw hat tilted over his brows, gazed at the placid sea before
him, and felt as lazy as was the atmosphere.</p>
<p>He had slept well, and breakfasted to his perfect content. Young, sanguine,
healthy, the mystery encompassing his brother Anthony's fate had not sufficed to
break his rest. The more than hinted-at doubts of Charlotte Guise--that Anthony
had been vat out of the world for ever by Mr. Castlemaine--failed to find their
response in George North's mind. The mere thought of it appeared to him to be
absurd: the suspicion far-fetched and impossible; the implied doubt of the
Master of Greylands little less than a libel on the name of Castlemaine. Men of
the world are inclined to be practical in their views, rather than imaginative:
and the young and hopeful look ever on the bright side of all things.</p>
<p>That Anthony's disappearance was most unaccountable, George North felt; his
continued absence, if indeed he still lived, was more strange still. There was
very much to be unravelled in connection with that past February night, and
George North intended to do his best to bring its doings to light: but that his
brother had been destroyed in the dreadful manner implied, he could not and
would not believe. Without giving credit to anything so terrible, there existed
ground enough, ay and more than enough, for distrust and uncertainty. And, just
as his sister-in-law, poor bereaved Charlotte, had taken up her abode at
Greylands under false colours, to devote herself to search out the mystery of
that disappearance within the Friar's Keep, so did George North resolve to take
up his. Nothing loth, was he, to make a sojourn there. Had Anthony presented
himself before him at that moment, safe and well, George would still have felt
inclined to stay; for the charms of Ethel Reene had made anything but a
transient impression on him. The world was his own, too; he had no particular
home in it; Greylands was as welcome to him as an abode as any other
resting-place.</p>
<p>John Bent came forth from the open door to join his guest. Landlords and
their ways in those days were different folks from what they are in these. He
wore no waistcoat under his loose linen coat, and his head was bare.</p>
<p>&quot;A nice stretch of water, that, sir,&quot; he said, respectfully, indicating the
wide sea, shining out in the distance.</p>
<p>&quot;It is indeed,&quot; replied George North. &quot;I think the place is a nice place
altogether. That sea, and the cliff, rising up there, would be worth sketching.
And there must be other pretty spots also.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;True enough, sir.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I feel inclined to bring over my pencils and take up my quarters with you
for a bit, and sketch these places. What do you say to it, Mr. Bent?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There's nothing I could say, sir, but that it would give me and my wife
pleasure if you did. We'd try and make you comfortable.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ay; I don't fear but you'd do that. Well, I think I shall go to Stilborough
and bring back my rattletraps. I saw a charming bit of scenery yesterday when I
went to call on the French lady. It is an archway covered with ivy: looking
through the opening, you catch a view of a cottage with a back-ground of trees.
There was a small rustic bridge also not far off, lying amid trees, and a stream
of water running under it, the whole dark and sheltered. These spots would make
admirable sketches.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No doubt, sir,&quot; returned John Bent by way of answer. &quot;But you'd have to
crave the leave of the Master of Greylands before making them. And that leave
might not be easy to get.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why not?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They be on his land, sir.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What of that? Surely he would not deny it! The great Creator has not been
churlish in making this world beautiful--should one man wish to keep any part of
it for the enjoyment of his own sole eyesight?&quot;</p>
<p>John Bent gave his head a shake. &quot;I don't think it is that Mr. Castlemaine
would do that, sir; he is not so selfish as that comes to; but he does not like
to see strangers about the place. He'd keep all strange folks out of Greylands
if he could: that's my belief.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why should he?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's just his pride and his exclusive temper, sir.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I thought I had heard Mr. Castlemaine described as a generous man; a
pleasant-tempered man,&quot; remarked Mr. North.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, and so he is, sir, when he chooses to be,&quot; confessed the landlord; &quot;I
don't say to the contrary. In many things he is as easy and liberal as a man can
be. But in regard to having strangers about his land, or in the place either, he
is just a despot. And I think the chances are ten to one, sir, against your
getting leave to sketch any spot of his.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can bat ask. If he refuses me, well and good. Of course I should not
attempt to defy him--though I am by no means sure that he, or any one else, has
the legal power to deny our copying nature's works, in man's possession though
they may be. Never mind. Enough free objects will be left for me: such as that
cliff, for example, and that glorious sea.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. North rose as he spoke. At that same moment two of the Grey Ladies were
crossing over from the Nunnery. Only one of them wore the dress of the
community, Sister Margaret. The other was Miss Castlemaine, in her flowing
mourning robes. Each of the ladies smiled kindly and gave the good-morrow to
John Bent. George North lifted his straw hat with reverence, and kept it off
until they should have passed.</p>
<p>Possibly the action, so uncharacteristic of most Englishmen, attracted
particularly the attention of Mary Ursula. Bending slightly her head to
acknowledge the courtesy, her eyes rested on the young man's face. Whether it
was his action, whether it was anything she saw in the face that struck on her,
certain it was that she half stopped to gaze upon him. She said nothing,
however, but passed on.</p>
<p>&quot;What a magnificent young woman!&quot; cried Mr. North, when the ladies were out
of hearing. &quot;She is beautiful. I mean the lady in mourning: not the Sister.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She is that, sir. It is Miss Castlemaine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Miss Castlemaine! Which Miss Castlemaine?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The late banker's daughter, sir. Niece to the Master of Greylands.&quot;</p>
<p>An hour later, the ladies went by again on their way homeward. John was
outside his door still, but alone, with a white cap on his head. Miss
Castlemaine accosted him.</p>
<p>&quot;Who was that gentleman we saw here just now, Mr. Bent?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;His name's North, madam: he is an artist.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Miss Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;Why did you inquire?&quot; asked Sister Margaret as they went on.</p>
<p>&quot;Because something in the stranger's face seemed to be familiar to me--as
though I had seen it before,&quot; replied Mary Ursula.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. George North, who seemed to do things rather upon impulse--or,
at least, not to lose time in putting in practice any resolution he might
make--had proceeded to Greylands' Rest to get the permission for sketching any
particular bits of scenery he fancied, which might be owned by Mr. Castlemaine.
He took the field way; the same way that he and the ladies had taken the
previous night, and he was nearly at the end of his journey when he encountered
Mr. Castlemaine who was coming forth from his house with Ethel Reene. Mr. North
lifted his hat, and approached to accost them.</p>
<p>&quot;I beg your pardon,&quot; he said to Mr. Castlemaine, bowing at the same time to
Ethel, &quot;I believe I have the honour of speaking to the Master of Greylands.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Castlemaine recognised him at once, as the young travelling artist whom
he had seen the previous day at the Turk's Head; the same who had just been
talked of at his breakfast-table. This Mr. George North, it turned out, was a
friend of Madame Guise, or, as Madame especially put it, of her late husband's.
A <i>gentleman</i> artist, Madame had said, for he was not dependent on his
profession; he had a good patrimony, and was of good family: and Mr. Castlemaine
had taken all in unsuspiciously. Apart from anything trenching on the mysteries
of that certain February night and of the Friar's Keep, whatever they might be,
he was the least suspicious man in the world: and it no more occurred to him to
connect this young man and his appearance at Greylands with that unhappy affair,
than he had connected Madame with it. Mr. Castlemaine had taken rather fancy to
this young artist when at the Turk's Head: he liked the look of his bright face
now, as he came up smiling: he warmed to the open, attractive manners.</p>
<p>George North preferred his request. He had come to Greylands the previous day
in the two-horse van from Stilborough for the purpose of calling on Madame
Guise; he had been struck with the pretty place and with the many charming bits
of scenery it presented, fit for the pencil: some of these spots he found
belonged to the Master of Greylands; would the Master of Greylands give him
permission to sketch them?</p>
<p>And taken, it must be repeated, by the applicant's looks and words; by his
winning face, his pleasing voice, his gentlemanly bearing altogether, Mr.
Castlemaine gave the permission off-hand, never staying to count the cost of any
after suggestions that might arise against it. Artists had come to the place
before; they had stayed a week or two and departed again, leaving no traces
behind: that the same would be the case with this present one, he never thought
to doubt. Mr. North was somewhat different from the others, though; inasmuch as
that he was known to Madame Guise (who vouched, so to say, for his being a
gentleman) and also that he had gained the liking of Mr. Castlemaine.</p>
<p>Mr. North warmly expressed his thanks for the readily-accorded permission.
Ethel had not spoken, but was blushing perpetually as she stood listening to
him--and for no cause whatever, she angrily told herself. Mr. North turned to
retrace his steps, and they all walked on together.</p>
<p>&quot;You have been acquainted with Madame Guise and her family some time, I
find,&quot; observed the Master of Greylands. &quot;Knew them abroad.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yes. Her husband was a dear friend of mine. We were like--&quot; Mr. North
hesitated, but brought the suggestive word out, as he had led to it--&quot;like
brothers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Was there anything peculiar in his death?&quot; asked Mr. Castlemaine. &quot;Madame
Guise seems to shrink so much from all mention of the subject that we can hardly
help fancying there was: and it is a topic that we cannot question her upon. He
died suddenly, she said one day, when some allusion was made to him, and that is
all we know. Mrs. Castlemaine observed that she shivered perceptibly as she said
it.</p>
<p>&quot;That is what I heard--that he died suddenly,&quot; assented Mr. North. &quot;I was
roaming about Italy at the time, and did not know of it for some months
afterwards. Madame Guise had left for England then. I procured her address; and,
being so near, called to see her yesterday.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Castlemaine slightly nodded--as if this part scarcely needed explanation.
&quot;Then you do not know what Monsieur Guise died of, Mr. North? She has not told
you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, she has not. I do not know what he died of. They were very much attached
to one another, and her avoidance of the subject may be perhaps natural. He was
an estimable young man, and my very good and dear friend.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus talking, the fields were traversed and they gained the road. Here their
routes lay in opposite directions: that of the Master of Greylands and Ethel to
the right, Mr. North's to the left. He was returning to the Dolphin before
starting on his walk to Stilborough.</p>
<p>&quot;You are staying at the inn, I presume,&quot; observed Mr. Castlemaine to him.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I am comfortable there, and the charges are very moderate. I called for
my bill this morning.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Called for your bill! Are you going away?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Only to come back again this afternoon. I left my portmanteau and pencils at
Stilborough.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, we shall be happy to welcome you at Greylands' Rest whenever you feel
inclined to call on Madame Guise,&quot; spoke Mr. Castlemaine in parting. &quot;Will you
dine with us this evening?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you. With very much pleasure.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Castlemaine cordially shook hands, and turned away. It was rare indeed
that the Master of Greylands condescended to be so free with a stranger--or, in
fact, with any one. Any previous visiting-artists to the place might have looked
in vain for a hand-shake. But his heart warmed to this young man; he knew not
why: and there was something in Mr. North's bearing, though it was perfectly
respectful to the Master of Greylands, which seemed to testify that he was, and
knew himself to be, of the same social standing in society; at least, that
gentleman's equal.</p>
<p>But that the propensity, which we all have, to take likes and dislikes seems
to obey no rule or law, and is never to be accounted for, it might be noticed as
a curious circumstance here. When Mr. Castlemaine first saw the unfortunate
Anthony, he had taken a dislike to him. How far the avowed errand of that young
man--the putting in a claim to Greylands' Rest--may have conduced to this,
cannot be told: Mr. Castlemaine would have said that it had nothing to do with
it; that he disliked him by instinct. Most people had seen nothing in Anthony
but what was to be liked; ay, and much liked; Mr. Castlemaine was an exception.
And yet, here was Anthony's brother (though Mr. Castlemaine knew it not) to whom
his heart was going out as it had never yet before gone out to a stranger! Truly
these instincts are more capricious than a woman's will!</p>
<p>George North ran into the Dolphin, caught up his umbrella to shield himself
from the sun, and started on his hot walk to Stilborough. In the course of the
afternoon he was back again with what he was pleased to call his rattletraps--a
portmanteau and a sketching-case--having chartered a fly to Greylands. There was
no two-horse van at his disposal that afternoon.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you get much of this fiery weather?&quot; he asked, throwing himself down by
Mrs. Bent in her sitting-room and his hat on the table, while the landlord saw
to his luggage.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, we have our share of it, sir, when it's a hot summer. And this is a
very hot one. Just see the sea yonder: even that looks hot.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I shall take a dip presently and try it,&quot; returned Mr. North. &quot;That must be
the best of living at the sea-side you get glorious baths.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You have not told me what you'd like for dinner yet, sir,&quot; resumed Mrs.
Bent, who was stripping currants into a pan, her face and the currants and the
cherry cap-ribbons all one and the same colour.</p>
<p>&quot;Dinner! Why, I am going to dine at Greylands' Rest. Its master asked me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<i>Did</i> he!&quot; cried Mrs. Bent in surprise. &quot;Well, that's a great thing for
him to do. He don't favour new-comers, sir.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He has so far favoured me. I say, Mrs. Bent,&quot; added the artist, a laughing
look in his bright eyes, &quot;what a pretty girl that is, up there!&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Bent raised her own eyes from the stripping, and shot forth an inquiring
glance. He was helping himself to the ripest bunches.</p>
<p>&quot;Miss Ethel Reene! Well, so she is, sir, and as good as she is pretty.
There's no love lost--as it is said--between her and her stepmother. At any
rate, on Mrs. Castlemaine's part. The servants say Miss Ethel gets snubbed and
put upon above a bit. She has to give way finely to the little one.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who is the little one?--Just look at this large bunch! Twenty on it, I
know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You'll get a surfeit, sir, if you eat at these sharp currants like that when
you are so hot.</p>
<p>&quot;Not I. I never tasted any so good.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I shall charge you for then, sir,&quot; she went on, laughing.</p>
<p>&quot;All right. Charge away. I have heard my father tell a tale of going into a
cherry-orchard once when he was a lad, he and three more boys. They paid
sixpence each, and eat what they liked. I fancy all four had a surfeit, or
something, after that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I dare be bound. Boys in a cherry-orchard! Do you get fine currants in
France, sir?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We get everything that's fine there,&quot; responded Mr. North, as well as he
could speak for the currants. &quot;But what little one were you talking of, Mrs.
Bent?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of Miss Flora, sir: Mrs. Castlemaine's daughter. A troublesome, ill-behaved
little chit, she is: always in mischief. The last time we were brewing; it's
only a few days ago; my young lady was passing the door and ran in: she went
rushing to the brewhouse, and fell backwards into the mash-tub. Fortunately the
liquor had been drawn off; but there she was, squealing in the wet grains.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. North laughed, and rose. Abandoning the currants, he put on his hat and
went leisurely out to take his plunge in the sea. By-and-by, when Mrs. Bent and
John were seated at tea, he came running back in a commotion, his wet towels in
his hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Can you tell me at what time they dine at Greylands' Rest?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;At six o'clock, sir, when they dine late,&quot; replied John &quot;Mostly, though,
it's in the middle of the day.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And as often five o'clock as six,&quot; put in Mrs. Bent. &quot;The earlier Mrs.
Castlemaine dines, the better she likes it. You have not half dried your hair,
sir.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I had no time for superfluous drying,&quot; he replied. &quot;It suddenly struck me
that I did not know the hour for dinner, and I came off as I could. Is that the
right time?&quot; looking at the clock. &quot;A quarter past five?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right to a minute, sir. This clock never fails.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you say, Mrs. Bent, that they sometimes dine at five. What will they
think of me?&quot;</p>
<p>He went leaping up the stairs, saying something about the thoughtless ways of
wandering Arabs--by which the landlord and his wife understood him to mean
artists. An incredibly short time, and he was down again, dressed, and striding
off to Greylands' Rest.</p>
<p>The first thing Mr. North noticed, on entering the gate of the garden, was
the flutter of a white dress amid a nest of trees. It was enough to assure him
that the dinner had not begun. He penetrated these trees, attracted by the
voices within, and found himself in sight of Ethel Reene, and the young damsel
recently spoken of--Miss Flora.</p>
<p>The white dress he had seen was Ethel's. It was an Indian sprigged muslin,
set off with black ribbons. Her rich brown hair, so bright in the flicker of
sunshine, had nothing to adorn it: her delicate face wore one of its sweetest
blushes as he approached. She sat in a kind of grotto formed by the trees, a
book resting in her lap while she talked to Flora. That young lady, unmindful of
her holiday attire--a costly and very pretty frock of grey silken gauze--for
Mrs. Castlemaine had said she might dine at table--was astride on one of the
branches. Ethel had in vain told her not to get up there. She jumped down at the
sight of Mr. North: the frock was caught, and the result was a woful rent.</p>
<p>&quot;There!&quot; exclaimed Ethel in an undertone, for Mr. North had not quite reached
them. &quot;Your beautiful new frock! What a pity! If I were mamma I should never buy
you anything but stuff and cotton.&quot;</p>
<p>Flora, even, looked down ruefully at the damage: the frock was new, as Ethel
said, costly, and beautiful.</p>
<p>&quot;Pin it up, Ethel.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have no pins here. Besides, pinning would not hold it. It can only be
mended. You had better show it to Eliza.&quot;</p>
<p>The spoilt child ran past Mr. North on her way indoors. He came up to Ethel,
bowed, and then held his hand out. With another bright and deeper blush she put
hers into it.</p>
<p>&quot;I shall get quite the English manners soon,&quot; he said, &quot;We do not shake hands
much in my country: especially with young ladies. They do not let us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you call France your country?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I am apt to do so, having lived there so much. I have been making
great haste here, Miss Reene, not knowing the hour for dinner.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We dine at six,&quot; replied Ethel. &quot;Mamma has but just returned from her drive,
and is dressing,&quot; she added, as if in apology for being the only one to receive
him. &quot;Papa has been out all the afternoon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is Madame Guise well to-day?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not very. She has one of her bad headaches, I am sorry to say, and is in her
room. She will be here shortly.&quot;</p>
<p>He sat down by Ethel, and took up the book she had been reading; a very old
and attractive book indeed--the &quot;Vicar of Wakefield.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What an excellent story it is!&quot; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&quot;Have you read it?&quot; asked Ethel, rising to proceed to the house.</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed I have. Twenty times, I should think. My mother had a small store of
these old English works, and and my brother revelled in them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You have brothers and sisters?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Only one sister now. She is married and lives in France.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, then I can understand why you like to go thither so much,&quot; said Ethel,
all unconscious that it was his native land; that he had never before been in
England. &quot;Is her husband French?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Mr. North. &quot;Oh, what a lovely rose!&quot; he cried, halting at a
tree they were passing, perhaps to change the conversation.</p>
<p>It was in truth one of rare beauty: small, bright, delicate, and of exquisite
fragrance. Ethel, in her impulsive good nature, in her innocent thoughtlessness,
plucked it and offered it to him. As he took it from her, their eyes met: in his
own shone a strangely-earnest look of gratitude for the gift, mingled with
admiration. Poor Ethel became crimson at the thought of what she had done, and
would have regained the flower had it been possible. She went on quickly to the
glassdoors of the drawing-room; Mr. North followed, placing the rose in his
buttonhole.</p>
<p>Madame Guise was entering the room by the inner door at the same moment. Mr.
and Mrs. Castlemaine soon, appeared; lastly, Miss Flora, in her mended frock.
Harry Castlemaine was not at home; some errand, either of business or pleasure,
had taken him to Stilborough. Harry had been out a great deal of late: there
seemed to be a restlessness upon him, and his father was beginning to notice it.</p>
<p>Mr. North was received (as he heard later from Madame Guise) quite en
famille--which pleased him much. No alteration was made in the usual style of
dinner: but the dinners at Greylands' Rest were always sufficiently good for
chance company. As George North sat at table, watching the master at the head
board, he could not bring himself to believe that Charlotte's suspicions were
correct. Good-looking, refined, courtly, pleasing, Mr. Castlemaine appeared to
be the very last man capable of committing a secret crime. Every other moment
some gesture of his, or glance, or tone in the voice, put George North in mind
of his father, Basil Castlemaine: and--no, he could not, he <i>could not</i>
join in the doubts of poor Anthony's wife.</p>
<p>But he noticed one thing. That ever and anon Mr. Castlemaine would seem to
forget where he was, forget his position as host, and fall into a fit of silent
abstraction, during which, a curiously-sad expression lay on his face, and his
brow was knit as with some painful care. He would rouse himself as soon as he
perceived he was mentally absent, and be in an instant the grand, courtly,
self-possessed Master of Greylands again. But the fits of gloom did occur, and
George North observed them.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he could not entertain the dread suspicions of his
sister-in-law. That a vast deal of mystery attached to his brother's
disappearance, and that Mr. Castlemaine was in some degree and manner connected
with it, or cognizant of it, he readily saw cause, to recognize: but, of the
darker accusation, he believed him to be innocent. And it went with George North
very much against the grain to sit at Mr. Castlemaine's hospitable table under
false colours, and not to declare the fact that he was his brother Basil's son.</p>
<p>Something of this he said to Madame Guise. Dinner over, the party strolled
into the garden, grateful for the little breath of air it brought. Mr. North
found himself momentarily alone with Madame, near the grand sweeping elm tree.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you mad, George?&quot; she hastily cried in French and in the deepest alarm,
in response to the word or two he whispered. &quot;Wish to declare yourself! not like
to be here only as Mr. North! For the love of heaven, recall your senses.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is terrible deceit, Charlotte.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you no longer care for your unfortunate brother? Have you lost all
remembrance of your love for him?--of the ties of kindred?--of the time when you
played together at your mother's knee! Do you think it cost me nothing to come
here under a wrong name--that it costs me no self reproaches to be here under
sham pretences, I who have as keen a sense of honour as you? But I do it for
Anthony's sake; I bear all the feeling of disgrace for him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That is just it,&quot; said George, &quot;as it seems to me. Disgrace.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It must be borne--for my sake, and for Anthony's. Were you to say, 'I am
George, Anthony's brother,' Mr. Castlemaine would take, alarm; he would turn you
out of the house, and me after you: and, rely upon it, we should never, discover
more of poor Anthony than we know now. It would still all be uncertain. No, mon
ami, go you away from Greylands if you like, and leave me to seek on alone; but,
declare yourself you must not. Anthony would rise from his grave at your
unnatural conduct.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Charlotte, you are exciting yourself for nothing,&quot; he hastily whispered, for
Mrs. Castlemaine was approaching. &quot;I did not say I was going to declare myself;
I only said how unpalatable to me is the acting of this deceit. But for
Anthony's sake and yours, I would not bear it for a moment; as circumstances
are, I must go on with it, and be George North perhaps to the end of the
chapter.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not to the end,&quot; she murmured, &quot;Not to the end. Anthony's fate will be
discovered before very long time has elapsed--or my prayers and tears will have
found no pity in heaven.&quot;</p>
<p>Only at dusk did they go in to tea. Afterwards, Ethel was bade to sing some
of her songs. George North--no mean musician himself, and with a soft, pleasant
voice of his own--sat by the piano, listening to their melody, gazing through
the twilight at her sweet face, and thinking that he had never been so nearly in
an earthly paradise.</p>
<p>When he took his departure, they accompanied him to the gate. The stars were
out, the night was clear and still, the heat yet excessive. It chanced that he
and Ethel walked side by side; it chanced that he held her hand, ay, and pressed
it too, longer than he had need have done when he said goodnight. That moment's
parting would remain in Ethel's memory for life; the heavy perfume of the
flowers lay around them, her heart and pulses were alike beating.</p>
<p>If she and George North had not fallen in love with one another, they were at
least on the highroad towards it.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h4><a name="div1_27" href="#div1Ref_27">CHAPTER XXVII.</a></h4>
<h5>IN THE VAULTS.</h5>
<br>

<p>Time had again gone on. It was autumn weather. Mr. George North was making a
tolerably long sojourn in the place, and seemed to be passing his days
agreeably. Sketching, boating, gossiping; one would have said he had no earthly
care. Perhaps he had not--save the one sweet care of making himself acceptable
to Ethel Reene.</p>
<p>The fate of each was over and done with long ago, so far as that grand
master-passion of the heart went--love. Ethel was helplessly in love with him
for all time. &quot;Ma caprice est faite,&quot; she might have said to Madame Guise in
that lady's native language; and Madame would have opened her eyes to hear it.
For in regard to the affection that had sprung up between those two young
people, Madame was entirely in the dark. Not very observant by nature, her whole
thoughts occupied with the one great trouble of her life, she remained wholly
unsuspicious of what was passing in the inner life of those around her.</p>
<p>George North's love for Ethel made his very existence. The purest, truest
affection man can feel, beat in his heart for Ethel Reene. To meet, was with
both of them the one great event of the day; the hope to be looked forward to
when they rose in the morning, the remembrance that glowed within their breasts
at night. On the solitary cliffs up by the coastguard station: or down on the
sheltered beach of the seashore, towards the Limpets; or amid the lovely scenery
where he carried his pencils--in one place or another they were sure to meet.
The soft wind seemed to whisper love-songs, the varying tints of the autumn
foliage were as the brilliant colours of the trees on the everlasting shores,
the very air was fraught with a heavenly perfume; and the world for each was as
the Garden of Eden.</p>
<p>Mrs. Castlemaine was no more wise than Madame. She had discerned nothing.
Perhaps their first intimacy grew during a few days that she was absent from
home. Disappointed of the promised excursion to Paris--for Mr. Castlemaine had
allowed the months to go on and on, and did not attempt to enter on it--Mrs.
Castlemaine set off on a ten days' visit to some friends in the adjoining
county, taking Flora with her. This was close upon the appearance of George
North at Greylands. Ethel, left at home under the chaperonage of Madame, saw a
good deal of Mr. George North: and the mutual liking, already rising in either
heart, perfected itself into love. Long before Mrs. Castlemaine's ten days of
absence had come to an end, they were secretly conscious that they were all in
all to each other.</p>
<p>Mrs. Castlemaine returned, and neither saw nor suspected anything. Perhaps
she was not likely to suspect. People don't go about betraying the most
secretive passion man can feel, or write the words, I love, in brazen letters on
their foreheads. True love is essentially reticent, hiding itself away from the
eye of man within the remotest folds of the shrinking heart. Neither had Mr.
North breathed a word to Ethel. He was not prepared to do it. Before he could
speak, he must be able to declare his own true name to her and to her
step-parents, to say &quot;I am George Castlemaine.&quot; And circumstances would not let
him do that yet.</p>
<p>He had learned absolutely nothing in regard to his brother's fate: to unravel
aught of the mystery attending it seemed to be beyond his power. He had
explored, as he believed, every nook and portion of the Friar's Keep; but
without success of any kind. It appeared to be a lonely, deserted, and in places
a dilapidated building, affording no spots for concealment. There existed not a
trace of Anthony; there was nothing to show that he had ever entered it. George
North stayed on at the Dolphin, waiting patiently for the elucidation that might
or might not come; listening, whenever they met, to his sister-in-law's most
persistent belief that it <i>would</i> come: and perfectly contented so to stay
on while he could see Ethel and feed his heart's love for her, though the stay
had been for ever.</p>
<br>

<p>Midnight was striking from the old turret-clock of the Grey Nunnery. Standing
at the open window of her bedchamber, was Miss Castlemaine. She had put off the
mourning for her father now, and assumed the grey dress of the Sisterhood. A
warm black shawl was wrapped about her shoulders, for the night air was somewhat
cold, and the breeze from the sea brought a chillness with it. It was late for
any of the Grey Sisters to be up; unless detained by sickness, they went to rest
early: but Miss Castlemaine had come in rather late from spending the evening at
Greylands' Rest, and had afterwards sat up writing a long letter. She had now
been in her room some little time, and had not yet begun to undress. To use an
old saying, she had no sleep in her eyes. Putting the warm shawl on, she opened
the window, and stood leaning on its sill, deep in thought as she gazed out at
the wide expanse of the sea. Hardly a night had passed of the past summer but
she had thus stood as she was standing now. To look thus over the still sea in
its calmness during this silent hour, or at its heaving waves, flashing white
under the moon or starlight, and lost in thought and care, was a positive luxury
to Miss Castlemaine. But these autumn nights were getting somewhat cold for it.</p>
<p>It was not her own proper chamber that she was in, but Sister Mildred's.
Sister Mildred was away. Her health was much better; but Mr. Parker, the doctor,
had said most positively that a change of a month or two was necessary to
complete her cure: and Sister Mildred departed to stay with some relatives whom
she had not seen for many years. She would be returning shortly now, and Mary
Ursula's occupancy of her room was only temporary. The approach of cold weather
had caused some necessary alterations in Mary Ursula's chamber--the old grate
was being replaced by a new one, and the chimney repaired: and during its
process, she occupied the chamber of Sister Mildred.</p>
<p>The lapse of months had not diminished the uneasiness of Mary Ursula's mind,
in regard to the disappearance of her unfortunate cousin Anthony in the Friar's
Keep. That Keep still wore for her an atmosphere of uncertainty and mystery. She
never thought of it--and it was more often in her thoughts than she would have
liked to say--but with one of those unpleasant thrills of renewed pain that
arise at times with us all, when some heavy sorrow or suspense lies latent in
the heart. Over and over again, since the night when Sister Mildred had
discovered to her the secret passage, and she had explored with that lady its
subterranean depth and length, had the wish--nay, the resolve--made itself heard
within her to go again through the same passage, and look a little about the
Friar's Keep. She knew not how, she knew not why, but the fear that Anthony had
been treacherously dealt with grew of stronger conviction day by day. Not by Mr.
Castlemaine: she could never fear that: and she resented the doubt cast upon him
by the world--which he in his haughty pride would not condescend to resent--and
believed that the discovery of the truth, if it could be made, would be doing
her uncle the best of services. By exploring, herself, the Friar's Keep, she
might be able to trace out nothing: but at least the strong desire to try lay
upon her. Is it not so with all of us? In any search or complexity, do we not
always mistrust others, and the capability of others, and think in our secret
hearts that we could succeed where they fail? The figure Mary had seen with her
own eyes, bearing its lamp, and which was religiously believed by the small
community of Greylands to be the ghost of the wicked monk, long dead and gone,
possessed no supernatural terrors for her. That it was some living personage,
personating the dead monk for a purpose, she felt sure of; and she could not
help fancying that in some unimaginable manner it must have to do with the
concealment of the fate of Anthony.</p>
<p>Circumstances had brought all these matters more especially to her mind
to-night. An old friend of hers, a Mrs. Hunter of Stilborough, had been also a
visitor, though a chance one, that evening at Greylands' Rest. Mrs. Hunter was
very fond of Mr. Castlemaine. She scouted the doubt thrown upon him in
connection with his vanished nephew, regarding it as the height of absurdity;
and to <i>show</i> this opinion of hers, rather liked talking of the affair. She
had introduced it that evening at Greylands' Rest, asking all sorts of questions
about the Keep, and about the ghost that sometimes appeared there, and about
Anthony. During this conversation, Mary Ursula noticed that her uncle was
remarkably silent; and once she caught a look of strangely painful uneasiness on
his face. As they were walking home--for it was Mr. Castlemaine himself who had
brought her back to the Grey Nunnery--she ventured to speak of it to him.</p>
<p>&quot;You have never heard in any way of Anthony, I suppose, Uncle James?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Never,&quot; was Mr. Castlemaine's reply.</p>
<p>&quot;Is it not strange that some of his friends in France do not inquire after
him? He must have had friends there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sure I don't know,&quot; was the curt answer.</p>
<p>&quot;What do <i>you</i> think became of him, uncle?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My dear, the affair has altogether so annoyed me that I don't care to think.
We will drop it, Mary Ursula.&quot;</p>
<p>Now, this was not satisfactory--and Mary felt that it was not. Of course it
closed her lips upon the subject of Anthony; but she put another question not
much less hazardous.</p>
<p>&quot;Who is that figure that shows himself sometimes as the ghost of the Grey
Monk?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I do not understand you.&quot;</p>
<p>The answer caused her to pause: the tone of it was, certainly resentful.</p>
<p>&quot;He walks about with his lamp, uncle.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Surely you do not believe in it--that it is really a ghost?&quot; she exclaimed
in astonishment.</p>
<p>&quot;I am content not to be wiser than my neighbours,&quot; replied Mr. Castlemaine.
&quot;I suppose I have some elements of superstition within me. We are none of us
responsible for our own nature, you know, Mary Ursula.&quot;</p>
<p>She said no more. In fact, they reached the Nunnery gate just then. Mr.
Castlemaine saw her indoors, and went back again. Mary sat late, writing her
letter, and then came up to her room.</p>
<p>She was thinking over it all now, as she stood at the window, the fresh sea
air blowing upon her somewhat heated brow. There was no moon, but the night was
passably light. Gentle waves stirred the surface of the water; a faint ripple
might be heard from the incoming tide. It had turned some three hours since, and
now covered, as Mary knew, the narrow path underneath the Nunnery, but not the
strip of beach at the Friar's Keep: that beach, however, would be inaccessible
for some hours, except by sea. Some night boats were out beyond Greylands,
fishing as usual: she could discover their lights in the distance. Almost
immediately opposite to her, and not far off, stood a two-masted vessel at
anchor. She wondered why it should have stayed in that solitary spot, so close
in-shore, instead of the more customary place off the beach. It may be almost
said that she saw and thought these things unconsciously in her mind's
preoccupation.</p>
<p>Nothing surprised her more--nay, half as much--as Mr. Castlemaine's implied
admission of his belief in the supernatural appearance of the Grey Friar. An
impression was abroad among the fishermen that the Castlemaines believed in the
ghost as fully as they themselves did: but until to-night Mary had smiled at
this. Look on what side she would, it seemed to be mystery upon mystery.</p>
<p>More food, than this subject, and quite as unpleasant, though of a different
nature, had been given to Mary that night by Mrs. Hunter. One of Mary's chief
friends in Stilborough had been a Mrs. Ord; she and Mary had been girls
together. The husband, Colonel Ord, was in India: the young wife, who was
delicate, remained at home. Sad news had now arrived from India. Colonel Ord was
dead. He had died suddenly; it was supposed in consequence of excitement at the
failure of an Indian Bank, in which all his property was placed. Mrs. Hunter had
imparted this news at Greylands' Rest: and she had moreover whispered an
announcement that had just been made public--the engagement of William
Blake-Gordon to the heiress of Mountsorrel. Little marvel that Mary's eyes had
no sleep in them!</p>
<p>Her reflections--and they were very painful--were interrupted by some stir
that appeared to be taking place on board the two-masted vessel. Suddenly, as it
seemed to her, two boats shot out from it, one after the other. The men, rowing
them, seemed to be steering right for this end of the Nunnery; and Mary watched
with surprise. No: they were making, it was quite evident now, for the Friar's
Keep higher up. Stretching out at the casement window as far as she dared
stretch, Mary saw them go straight on for the little beach there; she thought
she heard a bustle; she fancied she distinguished whispers. Wild ideas, devoid
of reason, arose within her: in the broad matter-of-fact daylight, she might
have felt ashamed of their improbability; but the imagination, when excited,
soars away on curious wings. Were these boats bringing back Anthony?</p>
<p>The night went on. She saw other boats come: she saw boats go back; she saw
them come again. Surely she was not dreaming all this! and yet it seemed an
impossible pageantry. At length a powerful impulse took possession of her--she
would go through the secret passage and try and solve the mystery: go then and
there.</p>
<p>Fastening her warm black shawl more securely round her, and tying on a dark
silk hood, she unlocked her drawers to get the keys of the passage, and
descended softly the stairs. In descending them it had not seemed very
lonely--though a sense of loneliness does strike upon one when making a solitary
pilgrimage about even an inhabited house at the dead of night, when everybody
else is abed and asleep. But when she came to go down the stone steps to the
damp vaults below, lighted only by the solitary lantern she held, then Mary's
courage deserted her. Brave and good woman though she was, she halted in a kind
of terror, and asked herself whether she could go on alone. Alone she must go if
she went at all: not for a great deal would she disclose the fact of this
existing passage to any of the Sisters, or let them know of her errand in it.
Sister Mildred was the only one who shared the secret, and Sister Mildred was
not there.</p>
<p>Taking a few minutes to recover herself; to strive, ay, and to pray for
returning courage; Mary at length went on. Arrived at the door, she unlocked it
with great trouble: the lock was no less rusty than before, and now there was
only one pair of hands to it; and she went swiftly along the passage in a sort
of desperate perseverance. The door at the other end unlocked, but with just as
much difficulty, she once more, for the second time in her life, found herself
in the cloistered vaults underneath the Keep.</p>
<p>Pausing again to gather what bravery would come to her, her hand pressed on
her beating heart, she then proceeded about the place with her lantern; throwing
its light here, throwing it there. At first she could see no trace of anyone,
living or dead; could hear no sound. Soon she halted abruptly; a thought had
come across her, bringing a sick fear--suppose she should not be able to find
her way back to the passage door, but must remain where she was until daylight?
Daylight! what light of day could penetrate those unearthly vaults?--they must
be always, by day and by night, as dark as the grave. As she stood undecided
whether to search further or to go back at once, she became conscious of a whiff
of fresh air, that brought with it a smell of the sea.</p>
<p>Stepping gently in its direction, she found herself at an opening. A door, it
seemed: whatever it was, it was open to the strip of beach under the Friar's
Keep, and to the sea beyond it. All seemed perfectly still: there was neither
sight nor sound of human being; but as she stood in the stillness she caught the
distant regular dip of the oars in the water, belonging no doubt to the
retreating boats.</p>
<p>What could it mean?--what could it all be? Even this opening, in the
hitherto-supposed-to-be impregnable walls--was it a new opening, or did it exist
always? Mary stood wondering, listening, looking; or, rather, peering: peering
into the darkness of the night, for it was not light enough to <i>look</i>.</p>
<p>These vaults, how much farther did they extend? She could not conjecture, and
dared not attempt to discover, lest she lost her way back again: all the
interstices of these pillared cloisters seemed one so like another that she
might not risk it. Turning away from the fresh breeze and the welcome smell of
the sea, she began to retrace her steps.</p>
<p>To retrace her steps, as she imagined, her thoughts very full. The question
had been mooted, by people unacquainted with the place--were there any means by
which the unfortunate Anthony Castlemaine could be effectually disposed of, if
the worst had happened to him: say, any facility for throwing him into the sea?
The answer had always been No, not from the Friar's Keep, for the Keep had no
communication of any kind with the sea, its walls were thick and impervious.
But, it seemed that there was a communication with the sea--as Mary had now just
seen. Her thoughts and her breath alike came unpleasantly quick, and she groped
along, and laid her disengaged hand on her bosom to still its pain.</p>
<p>But where was the door? Where? She thought she had been going in its
direction, but she had come far enough, and to spare, and here was no sign of
it. Was she indeed lost in this ghostly place? Her heart beat ten times more
wildly at the thought.</p>
<p>She was very cautious in the use of the lantern, lest it might betray her,
should anyone chance to be there: carrying it close before her, and keeping
three of its sides dark. She moved it here, she moved it there: but no trace of
the door did it shine upon; and in her desperation, she pushed down the three
dark slides, and flung the light aloft. Nothing was to be seen but the dark
stone floor of the vaults, their intersected pillars and arches above, and the
openings between them. One spot, one division, was ever just like another. Lost!
lost!</p>
<p>Her hand fell with the lantern: the drops of fear broke out on her face. At
that moment a sound, as of the banging of a door, echoed among the pillars, and
she hastily hid the glaring lantern under her shawl.</p>
<p>Other sounds came. Some door had evidently been shut, for now it was being
barred and bolted. It was not very near, and Mary Ursula waited. Then, turning
on the full light of her lantern again, and keeping her back to the sounds, she
went swiftly, blindly about, in search of the passage door.</p>
<p>Ah, what a blessing! There it was, now, before her. Perhaps in all her life
she had never experienced a moment of relief like that. A sound of joy faintly
escaped her; an aspiration of thankfulness went up from her heart.</p>
<p>She had brought the keys inside with her, as a precaution, in case the door
should close; they were tied together with string, and she had lodged the key
belonging to this door in the lock on this side: Sister Mildred had done the
same on the occasion of their first expedition. But now, as she stood there,
Mary found she could not easily draw the key out: it might have got turned in
the lock, and the lock was hard and unmanageable: so she had to put down the
lantern, first of all closing its three sides, and take both hands to the key.</p>
<p>She had just got it out and pushed the door open, and was gliding softly and
swiftly through, when a great bright light was thrown upon her, and a rough hand
grasped her shoulder. With a cry of awful terror, Mary turned, and saw a pistol
held close to her face.</p>
<p>&quot;O don't!&quot; she cried--&quot;spare me! spare me! I am Sister Mary Ursula--I am Miss
Castlemaine.&quot;</p>
<p>The man, who looked young, and was short and sturdy, turned in the doorway,
with his dark lantern, never speaking a word. At that unlucky moment, the door
swung against his elbow, and the pistol went off. Down he dropped with a hoarse
scream.</p>
<p>Whether Mary Ursula retained her senses for the instant, she never afterwards
knew. Fear, and the instinct of self-preservation, would have caused her to fly:
but how could she leave the wounded man to his fate? The whole place seemed to
be reeling around her; her head swam, and she stood back against the wall for
support.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you here alone?&quot; she asked, bending down, when she could get her breath
and some little strength into her shrinking spirit.</p>
<p>&quot;I be, ma'am. The rest are all gone.&quot;</p>
<p>Why! surely she knew that voice! Taking her lantern, she threw its light upon
his face, and recognized Walter Dance, Dance the fisherman's son: a young fellow
with whom she had had a friendly chat only yesterday: and to whom she had given
many a little present when he was a lad.</p>
<p>&quot;Is it you, Walter!&quot; she exclaimed, with the utmost astonishment--and to find
that it was he seemed to chase away as by magic her worst fears. &quot;What were you
doing here?&quot;</p>
<p>No answer--except some dismal groans.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you much hurt?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am just killed,&quot; he moaned. &quot;Oh, ma'am! who is to help me?&quot;</p>
<p>Who indeed! Mary Ursula had an innate dread of such calamities as this; she
had a true woman's sensitive heart, shrinking terribly from the very thought of
contact with these woes of life. &quot;I do not know that I can help you, Walter,&quot;
she said faintly. &quot;Where are you hurt? Do you think you could get up?&quot;</p>
<p>He began to try, and she helped him to his feet. One arm, the left, was
powerless; and the young man said his left side was also. He leaned upon her,
begging pardon for the liberty, and looked about him in dismay.</p>
<p>&quot;Where does this here passage lead to, ma'am?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To the Grey Nunnery. Could you manage to walk to it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I must get somewhere, lady, where I can be aided. I feel the blood
a-dripping down me. If the bullet is not inside of me, it must have bedded
itself in the wall.&quot;</p>
<p>The blood came from the arm. Beginning to feel faint again, feeling also very
much as though she had been the cause of this, perhaps had cost the young man
his life, Mary Ursula bound up the arm as well as she could, with her
hankerchief and with his.</p>
<p>&quot;Will you go on with me to the Nunnery, Walter?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, ma'am, an' I can get there. I never knew of this here passage.&quot;</p>
<p>She locked the door, took the keys and the two lanterns herself, giving him
the pistol, and bade Walter lean upon her. The walking seemed to hurt him very
much, and he moaned frequently. In spite of his hardy fisherman's life, he was a
very bad one to bear pain. When they came to the vaults of the Nunnery and, had
to ascend the stairs, his face turned livid, and he clutched Miss Castlemaine
tightly to save himself from falling. The pistol dropped from his hand once.</p>
<p>She got him into a small room off the kitchen, where accidents had been
attended to before--for, indeed, the Grey Nunnery was somewhat of a hospital,
and the good Sisters were its tender nurses. A wide, hard, capacious sofa was
there, and down he sank upon it. Mary stayed to light a candle, and then
hastened away to get help.</p>
<p>&quot;You shall have a little brandy directly, Walter,&quot; she said. &quot;I am going now
to call assistance: we must get Mr. Parker here.&quot;</p>
<p>He only moaned in answer: the agony in his side seemed dreadful: but as Miss
Castlemaine was leaving the room, he called her back again.</p>
<p>&quot;Lady,&quot; he cried with feverish earnestness, and there was a wildly eager look
in his eyes as they sought hers, &quot;don't tell how it was done; don't tell where
you saw me, or aught about it. I shall say my pistol went off in the chapel
ruins, and that I crawled here to your door to get succour. I've got a reason
for it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very well: be it so,&quot; assented Miss Castlemaine, after a pause of
reflection. It would be at least as inconvenient for her, were the truth
confessed, as for him.</p>
<p>He looked frightfully pale: and, to Miss Castlemaine's horror, she saw some
drops of blood dripping from his clothes, which must proceed from the wound in
his side. Flying up the stairs, she entered the first chamber, where Sisters Ann
and Phoeby slept; aroused them with a word or two of explanation, and was back
again almost instantly with some water and the flask of brandy kept for
emergencies. The Sisters were down almost as soon as she was; they were both
capable women in a case such as this, almost as good themselves as a doctor.
They saw to his side and bound it up, just as Mary Ursula had bound his arm.
Sister Ann then ran off for Mr. Parker, and Sister Phoeby went to the kitchen to
light the fire and prepare hot water, leaving Miss Castlemaine alone with the
patient.</p>
<br>

<h4><a name="div1_28" href="#div1Ref_28">CHAPTER XVIII.</a></h4>
<h5>OUT TO SHOOT A NIGHT-BIRD.</h5>
<br>

<p>Walter Dance's situation appeared to be critical. Miss Castlemaine (entirely
unused to accidents) feared it was so, and he himself fully believed it. He
thought that great common conqueror of us all, who is called the King of
Terrors, was upon him, Death, and it brought to him indeed a terror belonging
not to this world.</p>
<p>&quot;I am dying,&quot; he moaned; &quot;I am dying.&quot; And his frame shook as with an awful
ague, and his teeth chattered, and great beads of water stood on his livid face.
&quot;Lord, pardon me! Oh, ma'am, pray for me.&quot;</p>
<p>The young man had been all his life so especially undemonstrative that his
agitation was the more notable now from the very contrast. Mary, full of fear
herself and little less agitated than he, could only strive to appear calm, as
she bent over him and took his hands.</p>
<p>&quot;Nay, Walter, it may not be as serious as you fear; I think it is not,&quot; she
gently said. &quot;Mr. Parker will be here presently. Don't excite yourself, my good
lad; don't.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am dying,&quot; he reiterated; &quot;I shall never get over this. Oh, ma'am, you
ladies be like parsons for goodness: couldn't you say a prayer?&quot;</p>
<p>She knelt down and put up her hands to say a few words of earnest prayer;
just what she thought might best comfort him. One of his hands lay still, but he
stretched the other up, suffering it to touch hers. These ladies of the Nunnery
were looked upon by the fishermen as being very near to Heaven nearer (let it be
said under the breath) than was Parson Marston.</p>
<p>&quot;I've done a many wicked things, lady,&quot; he began when her voice ceased,
apparently saying it in the light of a confession. &quot;I've often angered father
and grandmother beyond bearing: and this night work, I've never liked it. I
suppose it's a wrong thing in God's sight: but father, he brought me in to't, as
'twere, and what was I to do?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What night work?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p>But there came no answer. Mary would not repeat the question. He was lying in
extreme agitation, shaking painfully. She put the brandy-and-water to his lips.</p>
<p>&quot;I must tell it afore I go,&quot; he resumed, as if in response to some battle
with himself. &quot;Ma'am you'll promise me never to repeat it again?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I never will,&quot; she replied earnestly, remembering that death-bed
confessions, made under the seal of secrecy, should, of all things, be held
sacred. &quot;If you have aught to confess, Walter, that it may comfort you to speak,
tell it me with every confidence, for I promise you that it shall never pass my
lips.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's not for my sake, you see, that it must be kept, but for their sakes:
the Castlemaines.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The what?&quot; she cried, not catching the words.</p>
<p>&quot;And for father's and the Commodore's, and all the rest of 'em. It would
spoil all, you see, ma'am, for the future--and they'd never forgive me as I lay
in my grave.&quot;</p>
<p>She wondered whether he was wandering. &quot;I do not understand you, Walter.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It all belongs to Mr. Castlemaine, father thinks, though the Commodore
manages it, and makes believe it's his. Sometimes he comes down, the master, and
sometimes Mr. Harry; but it's Teague and us that does it all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What is it that you are talking of?&quot; she reiterated.</p>
<p>&quot;The smuggling work,&quot; he whispered.</p>
<p>&quot;The smuggling work?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, the smuggling work. Oh, ma'am, don't ever tell of it! It would just be
the ruin of father and the men, and anger Mr. Castlemaine beyond bearing.&quot;</p>
<p>Her thoughts ran off to Mr. Superintendent Nettleby, and to the poor
fishermen, whom it was that officer's mission to suspect of possessing drams of
unlawful brandy and pouches of contraband tobacco. She certainly believed the
sick brain had lost its balance.</p>
<p>&quot;We've run a cargo to-night,&quot; he whispered; &quot;a good one too. The rest had
cleared off, and there was only me left to lock the doors. When I see the
glimmer of your light, ma'am, and somebody moving, I thought it was one of the
men left behind, but when I got up and found it was a woman's garments, I feared
it was a spy of the preventive officers come to betray us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What cargo did you run?&quot; she inquired, putting the one question from amid
her mind's general chaos.</p>
<p>&quot;I fancy 'twas lace. It generally is lace, father thinks. Nothing pays like
that.&quot;</p>
<p>Curious ideas were crowding on her, as she remembered the boats putting
backwards and forwards that night from the two-masted vessel, lying at anchor.
Of what strange secret was she being made cognisant? Could it be that some of
the mystery attaching to the Friar's Keep was about to be thus strangely and
most unexpectedly cleared to her?</p>
<p>&quot;Walter, let me understand. Do you mean to say that smuggling is carried on
in connection with the Friar's Keep?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, it is. It have been for years. Once a month, or so, there's a cargo
run: sometimes it's oftener. An underground passage leads from the Keep to the
Hutt, and the goods are stowed away in the cellar there till the Commodore can
take 'em away to the receivers in his spring cart.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And who knows of all this?&quot; she asked, after a pause. &quot;I mean in Greylands.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Only father and me,&quot; he faintly said, for he was getting exhausted. &quot;They've
not dared to trust anybody else. That's quite enough to know it--us. The sailors
bring in the goods, and we wheel 'em up the passage: Teague, and me, and father.
I've seen Mr. Harry put his hand to the barrow afore now. George Hallet--Jane's
brother--he knew of it, and helped too. We had to be trusted with it, him and
me, being on father's boat.&quot;</p>
<p>In the midst of her compassion and pity for this young man, a feeling of
resentment at his words arose in Mary's heart. There might be truth in the tale
he told in regard to the smuggling--nay, the manoeuvres of the boats that night
and the unsuspected door she had seen open to the narrow beach, seemed to
confirm it: but that this nefarious work was countenanced by, or even known to,
the Master of Greylands, she rejected utterly. If there was, in her belief, one
man more honourable than any other on the face of the earth, more proudly
conscious of his own rectitude, it was her Uncle James. Pride had always been
his failing. Walter Dance must be either partially wandering in mind to say it;
or else must have taken up a fallacious fancy: perhaps been imposed upon by his
father from some private motive. The work must be Teague's, and his only.</p>
<p>&quot;Walter, you are not in a condition to be contradicted,&quot; she said gently,
&quot;but I know you are mistaken as to Mr. Castlemaine. He could not hold any
cognisance of such an affair of cheating as this--or his son either.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, the business is theirs, ma'am; their very own: father don't feel a
doubt of it. The Commodore only manages it for 'em.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You may have been led to suppose that: but it is not, cannot be true. My
Uncle James is the soul of honour. Can you suppose it likely that a gentleman
like Mr. Castlemaine would lend himself to a long continued system of fraud?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I've always thought 'twas his,&quot; groaned Walter. &quot;I've seen him there
standing to look on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You must have been mistaken. Did you see him there to-night?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, ma'am.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nor any other night, my poor lad, as I will venture to answer for.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He might have been there to-night, though, without my seeing him,&quot; returned
the young man, who seemed scarcely conscious of her words.</p>
<p>&quot;How should you have left the vaults, but for this accident?&quot; she asked, the
question striking her.</p>
<p>&quot;I had locked the door on the sea, and was going straight up the passage to
the Hutt,&quot; he groaned, the pain in his side getting intolerable.</p>
<p>&quot;One question, Walter, and then I will not trouble you with more,&quot; she
breathed, and her voice took a trembling sound as she spoke. &quot;Carry your
thoughts back to that night, last February, when young Mr. Anthony was said to
disappear within the Friar's Keep----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know,&quot; he interrupted.</p>
<p>&quot;Was any cargo run that night?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can't tell,&quot; he answered, lifting his eyes for a moment to hers. &quot;I was
ill abed with a touch of the ague; I get it sometimes. I don't think father was
abroad that night, either.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Have you ever known, ever heard any hint, or rumour, from your father or the
Commodore or the sailors who run these cargoes, that could throw light on Mr.
Anthony's fate?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Never. Never a word.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who are the sailors that come?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mostly foreigners. Is it <i>very</i> sinful?&quot; he added in an access of
agony, more bodily than mental, putting out his one hand to touch hers. &quot;Very
sinful to have helped at this, though father did lead me? Will God forgive it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yes, yes,&quot; she answered. &quot;God is so merciful that He forgives every sin
repented of--sins that are a vast deal blacker than this. Besides, you have not
acted from your own will, it seems, but in obedience to authority.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think I'm dying,&quot; he murmured. &quot;I can't bear this pain long.&quot;</p>
<p>She wiped the dew from his face, and again held the brandy-and-water to his
lips. Walter Dance had always been in the highest degree sensitive, it may be
said excruciatingly sensitive, to physical pain. Many another man, lying as he
was now with these same injuries, would not have uttered a moan. Brave Tom
Dance, his father, was wont to tell him that if ever he met with a sharpish hurt
he'd turn out a very woman.</p>
<p>&quot;If Doctor Parker would but come!&quot; he cried restlessly. &quot;Lady, you are sure
he is sent for?&quot;</p>
<p>As if to answer the doubt, the gate-bell rang out, and Mr. Parker's voice was
heard, as he entered the Nunnery. Sister Ann had brought not only him, but John
Bent also. Miss Castlemaine felt vexed and much surprised to see the latter:
some faint idea, or hope, had been lying within her of keeping this untoward
affair secret, at least for a few hours; and nobody had a longer tongue in a
quiet way than the landlord of the Dolphin. She cast a look of reproach on the
Sister.</p>
<p>&quot;It was not my fault, madam,&quot; whispered Sister Ann, interpreting the glance.
&quot;Mr. Bent came over with us without as much as asking.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bless my heart, Walter Dance, here's a pretty kettle o' fish,&quot; began the
surgeon, looking down on the patient. &quot;You have shot yourself, Sister Ann says.
And now, how did that come to happen?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pistol went off unawares,&quot; groaned Walter. &quot;I think I'm dying.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not just yet, let us hope,&quot; said the doctor cheerily, as he began to take
off his coat and turn up his shirt-sleeves.</p>
<p>Sending Miss Castlemaine from the room, the doctor called for Sister Ann, who
had helped him before in attending to accidents, and had as good a nerve as he.
Mary, glad enough to be dismissed, went into the kitchen to Sister Phoeby, and
there indulged in a sudden burst of tears. The events of the night had strangely
unnerved her.</p>
<p>If Sister Ann exercised any speculation as to the cause of the displeasure
visible in the Superior's face at the sight of John Bent, she set it down solely
to the score of possible excitement to the patient. As she hastened to whisper,
it was not her fault. Upon returning back from fetching Mr. Parker, he and she
were bending their hasty steps across the road from the corner of the inn, when,
to the astonishment of both, the voice of John Bent accosted them, sounding loud
and clear in the silence of the night. Turning their heads, they saw the
landlord standing at his open door.</p>
<p>&quot;Keeping watch to see the sun rise, John?&quot; asked the doctor jestingly.</p>
<p>&quot;I am keeping watch for my lodger,&quot; replied the landlord in a grumbling tone,
for he was feeling the want of his bed and, resented the being kept out of it.
&quot;Mr. North went off this afternoon to a distance with his sketch-book and
things, ordering some supper to be ready at nine o'clock, as he should miss his
dinner, and he has never come back again. It is to be hoped he will come; that
we are not to have a second edition of the disappearance of young Anthony
Castlemaine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pooh!&quot; quoth the doctor. &quot;Mr. North has only lost his way.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I hope it may prove so!&quot; replied the landlord grimly: for his fears were at
work, though at present they took no definite shape. &quot;What sickness is calling
you abroad at this hour, doctor?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Young Walter Dance has shot himself,&quot; interposed Sister Ann, who had been
bursting with the strange news, and felt supremely elated at having somebody to
tell it to.</p>
<p>&quot;Walter Dance shot himself!&quot; echoed the landlord, following them, upon
impulse, to hear more. &quot;How?--where? How did he do it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Goodness knows!&quot; returned Sister Ann. &quot;He must have done it somewhere--and
come to the Nunnery somehow. Sister Mary Ursula was still sitting up, we
conclude--which was fortunate, as no time was lost. When we went to bed after
prayers, she remained in the parlour to write letters.&quot;</p>
<p>In the astonishment created by the tidings, John Bent went with them to the
Nunnery, leaving his own open door uncared for--but at that dead hour of the
morning there was little fear of strangers finding it so. That was the
explanation of his appearance. And there they were, the doctor and Sister Ann,
busy with the wounded man, and John Bent satisfying his curiosity by listening
to the few unconnected words of enlightenment that Walter chose to give as to
the cause of the accident, and by fingering the pistol, which lay on the table.</p>
<p>&quot;Will the injuries prove fatal?&quot; asked Miss Castlemaine of the surgeon, when
the latter at length came forth.</p>
<p>&quot;Dear me, no!&quot; was the reply, as he entered the parlour, at the door of which
she stood. &quot;Don't distress yourself by thinking of such a thing, my dear young
lady. Blood makes a great show, you know; and no doubt the pain in the side is
acute. There's no real cause for fear; not much damage, in fact: and he feels
all reassured, now I have put him to rights.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The ball was not in him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing of the kind. The side was torn a little and burnt, and of course
was, for one who feels pain as he does, intolerably painful. When I tell you
that the longest job will be the broken arm, and that it is the worse of the
two, you may judge for yourself how slight it all is. Slight, of course, in
comparison with what might have been, and with graver injuries.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did the ball go through the arm?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Only through the flesh. The bone no doubt snapped in falling: the arm must
have got awkwardly doubled wader him somehow. We shall soon have him well
again.&quot;</p>
<p>Mary gave vent to a little sob of thankfulness. It would have been an awful
thing for her had his life been sacrificed. She felt somewhat faint herself, and
sat down on the nearest chair.</p>
<p>&quot;This has been too much for you,&quot; said the doctor; &quot;you are not used to such
things. And you must have been sitting up very late, my dear young lady--which
is not at all right. Surely you could write your letters in the day-time!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I do things sometimes upon impulse; without reason,&quot; she answered with a
faint smile. &quot;Hearing sad news of an old friend of mine from Mrs. Hunter, whom I
met at Greylands' Rest last evening, I sat down to write to her soon after my
return.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And spun your letter out unconsciously--it is always the case. For my part,
I think there's a fascination in night work. Sit down when the house is still to
pen a few minutes' letter to a friend, and ten to one but you find yourself
still at it at the small hours of the morning. Well, it was lucky for young
Dance that you were up. You heard him at the door at once, he says, and hastened
to him.&quot;</p>
<p>A deep blush suffused her face. She could only tacitly uphold the deceit.</p>
<p>&quot;His is rather a lame tale, though, by the way--what I can understand of it,&quot;
resumed Mr. Parker. &quot;However, it did not do to question him closely, and the lad
was no doubt confused besides. We shall come to the bottom of it to-morrow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are going home?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no necessity whatever for me to stay. We have made him comfortable
for the rest of the night with pillows and blankets. Sister Ann means to sit up
with him: not that she need do it. To-morrow we will move him to his own home.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Will he be well enough for that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Quite. He might have been carried there now had means been at hand. And do
you go up to your bed at once, and get some rest,&quot; concluded the doctor, as he
shook hands and took his departure.</p>
<p>John Bent had already gone home. To his great relief, the first object he saw
was Mr. North, who arrived at the inn door, just as he himself did. The
surgeon's supposition, spoken carelessly though it was proved to be correct.
George North had missed his way in returning; had gone miles and miles out of
the road, and then had to retrace his steps.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm dead beat,&quot; he said to the landlord, with a half laugh. &quot;Fearfully
hungry, but too tired to eat. It all comes of my not knowing the country; and
there was nobody up to enquire the way of. By daylight, I should not have made
so stupid a mistake.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I have been worrying myself with all sorts of fancies, Sir,&quot; said
John. &quot;It seemed just as though you had gone off for good in the wake of young
Mr. Anthony Castlemaine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wish to goodness I had!&quot; was the impulsive, thoughtless rejoinder, spoken
with ringing earnestness.</p>
<p>&quot;Sir!&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. North recollected himself, and did what he could to repair the slip.</p>
<p>&quot;I should at least have had the pleasure of learning where this Mr. Anthony
Castlemaine had gone--and that would have been a satisfaction to you all
generally,&quot; he said carelessly.</p>
<p>&quot;You are making a joke of it, sir,&quot; said the landlord, in a tone of reproach.
&quot;With some of us it is a matter all too solemn: I fear it was so with him. What
will you take, sir?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A glass of ale--and then I will go up to bed. I am, as I say, too tired to
eat. And I am very sorry indeed, Mr. Bent, to have kept you up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's nothing, now you've come back in safety,&quot; was the hearty reply.
&quot;Besides, I'm not sorry it has happened so, sir, for I've had an adventure. That
young Walter Dance has gone and shot himself to-night; he is lying at the Grey
Nunnery, and I have but now been over there with Mr. Parker.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, how did he manage to do that?&quot; cried Mr. North, who knew young Dance
very well.</p>
<p>&quot;I hardly know, sir. We couldn't make top or tail of what he said: and the
doctor wouldn't have him bothered. It was something about shooting a night-bird
with a pistol, and he shot himself instead.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In the chapel ruins.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In the chapel ruins!&quot; echoed Mr. North--and he had it on the tip of his
tongue to say that Walter Dance would not go to the chapel ruins at night for
untold gold: but the landlord went on and interrupted the words.</p>
<p>&quot;He seemed to say it was the chapel ruins, sir; but we might have
misunderstood him. Any way, it sounds a bit mysterious. He was in a fine tremor
of pain when the doctor got in, thinking he was dying.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Poor fellow! It was only yesterday morning I went for a sail with him. Is he
seriously injured?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, sir; the damages turn out to be nothing much, now they are looked into.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am glad of that,&quot; said Mr. North; &quot;I like young Dance. Goodnight to you,
landlord. Or, rather, good-morning,&quot; he called back, as he went up the
staircase.</p>
<p>Miss Castlemaine also went to her bed. The first thing she did on reaching
her room was to look out for the two-masted vessel. Not a trace of it remained.
It must have heaved its anchor and sailed away in the silence of the night.</p>
<br>

<p>Mr. Parker was over betimes at the Grey Nunnery in the morning. His patient
was going on quite satisfactorily.</p>
<p>Reassured upon the point of there being no danger, and in considerably less
pain than at first, Walter Dance's spirits had gone up in a proportionate ratio.
He said he felt quite well enough to be removed home--which would be done after
breakfast.</p>
<p>&quot;Passato il pericolo, gabbato il santo,&quot; says the Italian proverb. We have
ours somewhat to the same effect, beginning &quot;When the devil was sick&quot;--which
being well known to the reader, need not be quoted. Young Mr. Walter Dance
presented an apt illustration of the same. On the previous night, when he
believed himself to be dying, he was ready and eager to tell every secret
pressing on his soul: this morning, finding he was going to live, his mood had
changed, and he could have bitten out his unfortunate tongue for its folly.</p>
<p>He was well disposed, as young men go, truthful, conscientious. It would have
gone against the grain with him to do an injury to any living man. He lay
dwelling on the injury he might now have done, by this disclosure, to many
people--and they were just those people whom, of all the world, he would most
care to cherish and respect. Well, there was but one thing to do now, he thought
truthful though he was by nature, he must eat his words, and so try and repair
the mischief.</p>
<p>Mary Ursula rose rather late. Walter Dance had had his breakfast when she got
down, and she was told of the doctor's good report. Much commotion had been
excited in the Nunnery when the Grey Ladies heard what had happened. They had
their curiosity, just as other people have theirs; and Sister Ann gave them the
version of the story which she had gathered. The young man had been up at the
chapel ruins to shoot a night-bird, the pistol had gone off, wounding him in the
arm and side, and he came crawling on all fours to the Grey Nunnery. The
superior, Sister Mary Ursula, sitting up late at her letters, heard him at the
door, helped him in, and called for assistance.</p>
<p>Well, it was a strange affair, the ladies decided; stranger than anything
that had happened at the Grey Nunnery before: but they trusted he would get over
it. And did not all events happen for the best! To think that it should be just
that night, of all others, that Sister Mary Ursula should have remained below!</p>
<p>Mary Ursula went into the sick-room, and was surprised at the improved looks
of the patient. His face had lost its great anxiety and was bright again. He
looked up at her gratefully, and smiled.</p>
<p>&quot;They are so kind to me, lady!--and I owe it all to you.&quot;</p>
<p>Mary Ursula sat down by the couch. Late though it was when she went to rest,
she had been unable to sleep, and had got up with one of the bad headaches to
which she was occasionally subject. The strange disclosure made to her by Walter
Dance, added to other matters, had troubled her brain and kept her awake. While
saying to herself that so disgraceful an aspersion on the Castlemaines was worse
than unjustifiable, outrageously improbable, some latent fear in her heart kept
suggesting the idea--what if it should be true! With the broad light of day, she
had intended to throw it quite to the winds--but she found that she could not.
The anxiety was tormenting her.</p>
<p>&quot;Walter,&quot; she began in a low tone, after cheerily talking a little with him
about his injuries, &quot;I want to speak to you of what you disclosed to me last
night. When I got up this morning I thought in truth I had dreamt it--that it
could not be true.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dreamt what?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>&quot;About the smuggling,&quot; she whispered. &quot;And about what you said, reflecting on
my uncle. You are more collected this morning; tell me what is truth and what is
not.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I must have talked a deal of nonsense last night, ma'am,&quot; spoke the young
man after a pause, as he turned his uneasy face to the wall--for uneasy it was
growing. &quot;I'm sure I can't remember it a bit.&quot;</p>
<p>She told him what he did say.</p>
<p>&quot;What a fool I must have been! 'Twas the pain, lady, made me fancy it.
Smugglers in the Friar's Keep! Well, that <i>is</i> good!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you mean to say it is not true?&quot; she cried eagerly.</p>
<p>&quot;Not a word on't, ma'am. I had a fever once, when I was a little 'un--I
talked a rare lot o' nonsense then. Enough to set the place afire, grandmother
said.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And there is no smuggling carried on?--and what you said to implicate Mr.
Castlemaine has no foundation save in your brain?&quot; she reiterated, half
bewildered with this new aspect.</p>
<p>&quot;If I said such outrageous things, my wits must have gone clean out of me,&quot;
asserted Walter. &quot;Mr. Castlemaine would be fit to hang me, ma'am, if it came to
his ears.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But--if there is nothing of the kind carried on, what of the boats last
night?&quot; asked Mary Ursula, collecting her senses a little. &quot;What were they
doing?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Boats, lady!&quot; returned Walter, showing the most supreme unconsciousness.
&quot;What boats?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Some boats that put off from an anchored vessel, and kept passing to and fro
between it and the Keep.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If there was boats, they must have come off for some purpose of their own,&quot;
asserted the young man, looking as puzzled as you please. &quot;And what did I do,
down where you found me, you ask, ma'am? Well, I did go there to shoot a bird;
that little strip o' beach is the quietest place for 'em.&quot;</p>
<p>Was he wandering now?--or had he been wandering then? Miss Castlemaine really
could not decide the question. But for having seen and heard the boats herself,
she would have believed the whole to be a disordered dream, induced by the
weakness arising from loss of blood.</p>
<p>&quot;But how did you get there, Walter?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Down that there slippery zigzag from the chapel ruins. The tide was partly
up, you say, ma'am? Oh, I don't mind wet legs, I don't. The door? Well, I've
always known about that there door, and I pushed it open: it don't do to talk of
it, and so we <i>don't</i> talk of it: it mightn't be liked, you see, ma'am.
'Twas hearing a stir inside it made me go in: I said to myself, had a bird got
there? and when I saw your light, ma'am, I was nigh frightened to death. As to
boats--I'm sure there was none.&quot;</p>
<p>And that was all Mary could get from Mr. Walter Dance this morning. Press him
as she might now--though she did not dare to press him too much for fear of
exciting fever--she could get no other answer, no confirmatory admission of any
kind. And he earnestly begged her, for the love of heaven, never to repeat a
word of his &quot;tattle&quot; to his father, or elsewhere.</p>
<p>In the course of the morning, Tom Dance and two or three fishermen-friends of
his came to the Grey Nunnery to convey Walter home. The rumour of what had
happened had caused the greatest commotion abroad, and all the village, men and
women, turned out to look for the removal. Fishermen, for that tide, abandoned
their boats, women their homes and their household cares. No such excitement had
arisen for Greylands since the vanishing of Anthony Castlemaine as this. The
crowd attended him to Tom Dance's door with much hubbub; and after his
disappearance within it, stayed to make their comments: giving praises to those
good Grey Ladies who had received and succoured him.</p>
<p>&quot;Now then,&quot; cried the doctor to his patient, when he had placed him
comfortably in bed at his father's house and seen him take some refreshment, no
one being present but themselves, &quot;what is the true history of this matter,
Walter? I did not care to question you much before.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The true history?&quot; faltered Walter; who was not the best hand at deception
that the world could produce.</p>
<p>&quot;What brought you in the chapel ruins with a loaded pistol at that untoward
time of night?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wanted to shoot a sea-bird: them that come abroad at night,&quot; was the
uneasy answer. &quot;A gentleman at Stilborough gave me an order for one. He's
a-going to get him stuffed.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker looked at the speaker keenly. He detected the uneasiness at being
questioned.</p>
<p>&quot;And you thought that hour of the morning and that particular spot the best
to shoot the bird?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Them birds are always hovering about the ruins there,&quot; spoke Walter,
shifting his eyes in all directions. &quot;Always a'most. One can only get at 'em at
pitch dark, when things are dead still.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I thought, too, that birds were generally shot with guns, not pistols,&quot; said
the surgeon; and the young man only; groaned in answer to this: in explanation
of which groan he volunteered the information that his &quot;arm gave him a twitch.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where did you get the pistol?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Father lent it to me,&quot; said Walter, apparently in much torment, &quot;to shoot
the bird.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And how came the pistol to go off as it did?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was raising it to shoot one, a big fellow he was, and my elbow knocked
again that there piece of sticking-out wall in the corner. Oh, doctor! I'm
feeling rare and faint again.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker desisted from his investigation and went away whistling, taking in
just as much as he liked of the story, and no more. There was evidently some
mystery in the matter that he could not fathom.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h4><a name="div1_29" href="#div1Ref_29">CHAPTER XXIX.</a></h4>
<h5>ONE MORE INTERVIEW.</h5>
<br>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Bent were in their sitting-room, facing the sea, as many guests
around them as the room could conveniently accommodate. Much excitement
prevailed: every tongue was going.</p>
<p>Upon the occasion of any unusual commotion at Greylands, the Dolphin, being
the only inn in the place, was naturally made the centre point of the public,
where expressions of marvel were freely given vent to and opinions exchanged.</p>
<p>Since the disappearance of Anthony Castlemaine, no event had occurred to
excite the people like unto this--the shooting himself of young Walter Dance. To
the primitive community this affair seemed nearly as unaccountable as that. The
bare fact of the pistol's having gone off through the young man's inadvertently
knocking his elbow against that bit of projecting wall, sticking itself out in
the corner of the chapel ruins, was nothing extraordinary; it might have
happened to anybody; but the wonder manifested lay in the attendant
circumstances.</p>
<p>After the stir and bustle of seeing Walter Dance conveyed from the Grey
Nunnery to his home had somewhat subsided, and the litter with its bearers, and
the patient, and the doctor had fairly disappeared within doors, and they were
barred out, the attendant spectators stayed a few minutes to digest the sight,
and then moved off slowly by twos and threes to the Dolphin. The privileged
among them went into Mr. and Mrs. Bent's room: the rest stayed outside. Marvel
the first was, that young Dance should have gone out to shoot a bird at that
uncanny hour of the morning; marvel the second was, that he should have chosen
that haunted place, the chapel ruins, for nobody had evinced more fear in a
silent way of the superstitions attending the Keep and the ghost that walked
there than Walter Dance; marvel the third was, that he should have taken a
pistol to shoot at the sea-bird, instead of a gun.</p>
<p>&quot;Why couldn't he have got the bird at eight or nine o'clock at night?&quot;
debated Ben Little, quite an old oracle in the village and the father of young
Ben. &quot;That's the best hour for them sea-birds: nobody in their senses would wait
till a'most the dawn.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And look here,&quot; cried out Mrs. Bent shrilly: but she was obliged to be
shrill to get a general hearing. &quot;Why did he have a pistol with him? Tom Dance
keeps a gun: he takes it out in his boat sometimes; but he keeps no pistol.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Young Walter said in the night, to me and the doctor, that it was his
father's pistol when we asked him about it,&quot; interposed John Bent.</p>
<p>&quot;Rubbish!&quot; returned the landlady. &quot;I know better. Tom Dance never owned a
pistol yet: how should he, and me not see it There's not a man in the whole
place that keeps a pistol.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Except Mr. Superintendent Nettleby,&quot; put in old Ben.</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody was bringing <i>him</i> in,&quot; retorted the landlady, &quot;it's his
business to keep a pistol. My husband, as you all know, thought it was a pistol
he heard go off the night that young Mr. Castlemaine was missed, though the
Commodore stood to it that it was his gun--and, as we said then, if it was a
pistol, where did the pistol come from? Pistols here, pistols there: I should
like to ask what we are all coming to! We sha'n't be able to step out of our
door after dark next, if pistols jump into fashion.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;At any rate, it seems it was a pistol last night, wherever he might have got
it from,&quot; said Ben Little. &quot;And downright careless it must have been of him to
let it go off in the way he says it did--just for knocking his elbow again' the
wall. Its to be known yet whether that there's not a lame tale; invented to
excuse hisself.&quot;</p>
<p>Several faces were turned on old Ben Little at this. His drift was scarcely
understood.</p>
<p>&quot;Excuse himself from what?&quot; demanded Mrs. Bent sharply. &quot;Do you suppose the
young fellow would shoot himself purposely, Ben Little?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What I think,&quot; said Ben, with calmness, &quot;if one could come to the bottom of
it, is this: that there young fellow got a fright last night--see the Grey Friar
most probable; and his hand shook so that the pistol went off of itself.&quot;</p>
<p>This was so entirely new a view of probabilities, that the room sunk into
temporary silence to revolve it. And not altogether an agreeable one. The Grey
Friar did enough mischief as it was, in the matter of terrifying timid spirits:
if it came to causing dreadful personal injuries with pistols and what not,
Greylands was at a pretty pass!</p>
<p>&quot;Now I shouldn't wonder but that was it,&quot; cried John Bent, bringing down his
hand on the table emphatically. &quot;He saw the Grey Friar, or thought he did: and
it put him into more fright than mortal man could stand. You should just have
seen him last night, and the terror he was in, when me and the doctor got to
him--shaking the very board he lay upon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sure he caused <i>us</i> fright enough,&quot; meekly interposed Sister Ann,
who had been drawn into the inn (nothing loth) with the crowd. &quot;When the Lady
Superior, Sister Mary Ursula, came up to awake me and Sister Phoeby, and we saw
her trembling white face, and heard that Walter Dance had taken refuge at the
Nunnery, all shot about, neither of us knew how we flung our things on, to get
down to him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Walter Dance don't like going anigh the Friar's Keep any more nor the rest
of us likes it; and I can't think what should have took him there last night,&quot;
spoke up young Mr. Pike from the general shop. &quot;I was talking to him yesterday
evening for a good half hour if I was talking a minute; 'twas when I was
shutting up: he said nothing then about going out to shoot a bird.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But he must have went to shoot one,&quot; insisted Ben Little. &quot;Why say he did it
if he didn't? What else took him to the ruins at all?&quot;</p>
<p>A fresh comer appeared upon the scene at this juncture in the person of Mr.
Harry Castlemaine. In passing the inn, he saw signs of the commotion going on,
inside and outside, and turned in to see and hear. The various doubts and
surmises, agitating the assembly, were poured freely into his ear.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, it's all right--that's what young Dance went up for,&quot; said he, speaking
lightly. &quot;A day or two ago I chanced to hear him say he wanted to shoot a
sea-bird for stuffing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, sir that may be it; no doubt it is, else why should he say it--as I've
just asked,&quot; replied Ben Little. &quot;But what we'd like to know is--why he should
ha' stayed to the little hours of morning before he went out. Why not have went
just after dark?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He may have been busy,&quot; said Mr. Harry carelessly. &quot;Or out in the boat.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He wasn't out in the boat last night, sir, for I was talking to him as late
as nine o'clock at our door,&quot; said young Pike. &quot;The boat couldn't have went out
after that and come back again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I don't think it can concern us whether he went out after this bird a
little later or a little earlier; or in fact that it signifies at all which it
was, to the matter in question,&quot; returned the Master of Greylands' son: and it
might have been noticed that his tone bore a smattering of the haughty reserve
that sometimes characterised his father's. &quot;The poor fellow has met with the
accident; and that's quite enough for him without being worried with queries as
to the precise half hour it happened.'</p>
<p>&quot;What he says is this here, Mr. Harry: that a great big sea-bird came flying
off the sea, flapping its wings above the ruins; Dance cocked his pistol and
raised it to take aim, when his elbow struck again' the corner wall there, and
the charge went off.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just so, Ben; that's what Tom Dance tells me,&quot; responded Mr. Harry to old
Little, for he had been the speaker. &quot;It will be a lesson to him, I dare say,
not to go out shooting birds in the dark again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not to shoot 'em <i>there</i>, at any rate,&quot; rejoined Ben. &quot;The conclusion
we've just been and drawed is this here, Mr. Harry, sir: that the Grey Friar's
shade appeared to him and set him trembling, and the dratted pistol went off of
itself.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Harry's face grew long at once. &quot;Poor fellow! it may have been so,&quot; he
said: &quot;and that alone would make his account confused. Well, my friends, the
least we can do, as it seems to me, is to leave Walter Dance alone and not
bother him,&quot; he continued in conclusion: and out he went as grave as a judge.
Evidently the Grey Friar was not sneered at by Mr. Harry Castlemaine.</p>
<p>Sitting in a quiet corner of the room, obscured by the people and by the
hubbub, was the Dolphin's guest, George North. Not a word, spoken, had escaped
him. To every suggestive supposition, to every remark, reasonable and
unreasonable, he had listened attentively. For this affair had made more
impression on him than the facts might seem to warrant: and in his own mind he
could not help connecting this shot and this mysterious pistol--that seemed to
have come into Walter Dance's possession unaccountably--with the shot of that
past February night, that had been so fatal to his brother.</p>
<p>Fatal, at least, in the conviction of many a one at Greylands. From John Bent
to Mr. George North's sister-in-law, Charlotte Guise, and with sundry
intermediate persons the impression existed and could not be shaken off. Mr.
North had never given in to the belief: he had put faith in Mr. Castlemaine: he
had persistently hoped that Anthony might not be dead; that he would reappear
some time and clear up the mystery: but an idea had now taken sudden hold of him
that this second edition of a shot, or rather the cause of it, would be found to
hold some connection with the other shot: and that the two might proceed from
the Grey Friar. Not the ghost of a Grey Friar, but a living and substantial one,
who might wish to keep his precincts uninvaded. We, who are in the secret of
this later shot, can see how unfounded the idea was: but Mr. North was not in
the secret, and it had taken (he knew not why) firm hold of him.</p>
<p>First of all, he had no more faith in the lame account of Mr. Walter Dance
than the doctor had. It may be remembered that when the landlord was telling him
of the accident the previous night, Mr. North remarked that he had been with
Dance for a sail only that same morning. During this sail, which had lasted
about two hours, the conversation had turned on the Friar's Keep--Mr. North
frequently, in an apparently indirect manner, did turn his converse on it--and
Walter Dance had expressed the most unequivocal faith in the Grey Monk that
haunted it, and protested, with a shake of superstitions terror, that he would
not go &quot;anigh them parts&quot; after dark for all the world. Therefore Mr. North did
not take in the report that he had voluntarily gone to the chapel ruins to shoot
a bird in the dead of the night.</p>
<p>The talkers around Mr. North all agreed, receiving their version of the
affair from Sister Ann and John Bent, that Walter Dance's account was imperfect,
confused, and not clearly to be understood; and that he was three parts beside
himself with nervous fear when he gave it. All food for Mr. George North: but he
listened on, saying nothing.</p>
<p>When Harry Castlemaine quitted the Dolphin, he turned in the direction of
Stilborough; he was going to walk thither--which was nothing for his long legs.
In ascending the hill past the church, which was a narrow and exceedingly lonely
part of the road, the yew-trees overshadowing the gloomy churchyard on one side,
the dark towering cliff on the other, he encountered Jane Hallet. She had been
to Stilborough on some errand connected with her knitting-work, and was now
coming back again. They met just abreast of the churchyard gate, and
simultaneously stopped: as if to stop was with both of them a matter of course.</p>
<p>&quot;Where have you been, Jane?&quot; asked Mr. Harry.</p>
<p>&quot;To Stilborough,&quot; she answered.</p>
<p>&quot;You must have gone early.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I went for wool&quot;--indicating a brown-paper parcel in her hand.</p>
<p>&quot;For wool!&quot; he repeated, in a somewhat annoyed tone. &quot;I have told you not to
worry yourself with more of that needless work, Jane.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And make my aunt more displeased than she is with me!&quot; returned Jane sadly.
&quot;I must keep on with it as long as I can, while in her sight.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I think you must have enough to do without that,&quot; he answered,
dropping the point. &quot;How pale you are, Jane.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am tired. It is a long walk, there and back, without rest. I sat down on
one of the shop stools while they weighed the wool, but it was not much rest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There again! I have told you the walk is too far. Why don't you attend to
me, Jane?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wish I could: but it is so difficult. You know what my aunt is.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am not sure, Jane, but it will be better to--to--&quot; he stopped, seemingly
intent on treading a stone into the path--&quot;to make the change now,&quot; he went on,
&quot;and get the bother over. It must come, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not yet; no need to do it yet,&quot; she quickly answered. &quot;Let it be put off as
long as it can be. I dread it frightfully.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, that's it: you are tormenting yourself into fiddle-strings. Don't be
foolish, Jane. It is I who shall have to bear the storm, not you: and my back's
broad enough, I hope.&quot;</p>
<p>She sighed deeply: her pale, thoughtful, pretty face cast up in sad
apprehension towards the blue autumn sky. A change came over its expression:
some remembrance seemed suddenly to occur to her.</p>
<p>&quot;Have you heard any news about Walter Dance?&quot; she asked with animation. &quot;As I
came down the cliff this morning, Mrs. Bent was leaving the baker's with some
hot rolls in her apron, and she crossed over to tell me that Walter had shot
himself accidentally at the chapel ruins in the middle of the night. Is it
true?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Shot himself instead of a sea-bird,&quot; slightingly responded Mr. Harry.</p>
<p>&quot;And in the chapel ruins?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I hear he says so.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But--that is not likely to be the truth, is it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How should I know, Jane?&quot;</p>
<p>She lodged the paper parcel on the top of the gate, holding it with one hand,
and looked wistfully across the graveyard. Harry Castlemaine whistled to a
sparrow that was chirping on a branch of the nearest yew-tree.</p>
<p>&quot;Was it Mr. Nettleby who did it?&quot; she inquired, in a low, hesitating whisper.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Nettleby!&quot; repeated Harry Castlemaine in astonishment, breaking of his
whistle to the bird. &quot;What in the world makes you ask that Jane?&quot;</p>
<p>A faint colour passed over her thin face, and she paused before answering.</p>
<p>&quot;Mrs. Bent said she thought nobody in the place possessed a pistol except
Superintendent Nettleby.&quot;</p>
<p>He looked keenly at Jane: at her evident uneasiness. She was growing pale
again; paler than before; with what looked like an unnatural pallor. Mr. Harry
Castlemaine's brow knitted itself into lines, with the effort to make Jane out.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't like the chapel ruins: or the Friar's Keep,&quot; she went on, in the
same low tone. &quot;I wish nobody ever went near them. I wish <i>you</i> would not
go!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wish <i>I</i> would not go!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;What do you mean, Jane?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It may be your turn next to be shot,&quot; she said with rising emotion, so much
so that the words came out jerkingly.</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot tell what it is that you are driving at,&quot; he answered, regarding
searchingly the evidently tired frame, the unmistakable agitation and anxiety of
the thin, white face. &quot;What have I to do with the chapel ruins? I don't go
roaming about at night with a pistol to shoot sea-birds.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you would but make a confidante of me!&quot; she sighed.</p>
<p>&quot;What have I to confide? If you will tell me what it is, perhaps I may. <i>I</i>
don't know.&quot;</p>
<p>She glanced up at him, flushing again slightly. His countenance was
unembarrassed, open, and kind in its expression; but the decisive lips were set
firmly. Whether he knew what she meant, or whether he did not, it was evident
that he would not meet her in the slightest degree.</p>
<p>&quot;Please do not be angry with me,&quot; faltered Jane.</p>
<p>&quot;When am I angry with you? Simply, though, I do not understand you this
morning, Jane. I think you must have tired yourself too much.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am tired,&quot; she replied; &quot;and I shall be glad to get home to rest. My aunt,
too, will be thinking it is time I was back.&quot;</p>
<p>She moved her parcel of wool off the gate, and, after another word or two,
they parted: Jane going down hill, Harry Castlemaine up. Before he was quite
beyond view, he stood to look back at her, and saw she had turned to look after
him. A bright smile illumined his handsome face, and he waved his hand to her
gaily. Few, very few, were there, so attractive as Harry Castlemaine.</p>
<p>Jane's lips parted with a farewell word, though he could not hear it, and her
pretty dimples were all smiles as she went onwards. At the foot of the cliff she
came upon little Bessy Gleeson in trouble. The child had fallen, goodness knew
from what height, had cut both her knees, and was sobbing finely. Jane took the
little thing up tenderly, kissed and soothed her, and then carried her up the
cliff to the Gleesons' cottage. What with Bessy and what with the parcel, she
could not breathe when she got there. Down she dropped on the stone by the door,
her face whiter than ever.</p>
<p>&quot;Where's mother?&quot; she asked, as some of the little ones, Polly included, came
running out.</p>
<p>But Nancy Gleeson had seen the ascent from the side window, and came forward,
her hands all soap-suds. She was struck with Jane's exhausted look.</p>
<p>&quot;Bessy has fallen down, Mrs. Gleeson. Her knees are bleeding.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And how could you think of lugging her all up the cliff, Miss Jane! I
declare you be as white as a sheet. A fat, heavy child like her! Fell down on
your knees, have you, you tiresome little grub. There's one or another on you
always a-doing of it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is a warm morning, and I have been walking to and from Stilborough,&quot;
remarked Jane, as she rose to go on, and not choosing to be told she looked
white without accounting for it. &quot;Wash her knees with some hot water please,
Mrs. Gleeson: I dare say she is in pain, poor little thing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lawk a me, Miss Jane,&quot; the woman called after her, &quot;if you had half-a-dozen
of 'em about you always you'd know better nor to take notice o' such trifles as
knees.&quot; But Jane was already nearly out of hearing.</p>
<p>Harry was not the only one of the Castlemaine family who went that day to
Stilborough. In the full brightness of the afternoon, the close carriage of the
Master of Greylands, attended by its liveried servants, might have been seen
bowling on its way thither, and one lady, attired in the dress of the Grey
Sisters, seated inside it. A lady who was grand, and noble, and beautiful, in
spite of the simple attire--Mary Ursula.</p>
<p>She was about to pay a visit to that friend of hers on whom misfortune had
fallen--Mrs. Ord. The double calamity--loss of husband and loss of
fortune--reaching Mrs. Ord by the same mail, had thrown her upon a sick-bed; and
she was at all times delicate. The letter that Mary had sat up to write was
despatched by a messenger early in the morning: and she had craved the loan of
her uncle's close carriage to convey her on a personal visit. The <i>close</i>
carriage: Mary shrunk (perhaps from the novelty of it) from showing herself this
first time in her changed dress among her native townspeople.</p>
<p>The carriage left her at Mrs. Ord's house, and was directed to return for her
in an hour; and Mary was shown up to the sick-chamber. It was a sad interview:
this poor Mrs. Ord--whose woes, however, need not be entered upon here in
detail, as she has nothing to do with the story--was but a year or two older
than Mary Ursula. They had been girls together. She was very ill now: and Mary
felt that at this early stage little or no consolation could be offered. She
herself had had her sorrows since they last met, and it was a trying hour to
both of them. Before the hour had expired, Mary took her leave and went do
wn to
the drawing-room to wait for the carriage.</p>
<p>She had closed the door, and was halfway across the richly-carpeted floor,
before she became aware that any one was in the room. It was a gentleman--who
rose from the depths of a lounging-chair at her approach. Every drop of blood in
Mary's veins seemed to stand still, and then rush wildly on: her sight
momentarily failed her, her senses were confused: and but that she had shut the
door behind her, and come so far, she might have retreated again. For it was
William Blake-Gordon.</p>
<p>They stood facing each other for an instant in silence, both painfully
agitated. Mary's grey bonnet was in her hand; she had taken it off in the
sick-chamber; he held an open letter, that he had been apparently reading to
pass away the time, while the servants should carry his message to their sick
mistress and bring back an answer. Mary saw the writing of the letter and
recognized it for Agatha Mountsorrel's. In his confusion, as he hastily
attempted to refold the letter, it escaped his hand, and fluttered to the
ground. The other hand he was holding out to her.</p>
<p>She met it, scarcely perhaps conscious of what she did. He felt the trembling
of the fingers he saw the agitation of the wan white face. Not a word did either
of them speak. Mary sat down on a sofa, he took a chair near, after picking up
his letter.</p>
<p>&quot;What a terrible calamity this is that has fallen on Mrs. Ord!&quot; he exclaimed,
seizing upon it as something to say.</p>
<p>&quot;Two calamities,&quot; answered Mary.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes indeed. Her husband dead, and her fortune gone! My father sent me here
to inquire personally after her; to see her if possible. He and Colonel Ord were
good friends.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I do not think she can see you. She said that I was the only one friend who
would have been admitted to her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I did not expect she would: but Sir Richard made me come. You know his way.&quot;</p>
<p>Mary slightly nodded assent. She raised her hand and gently pushed from her
temple the braid of her thick brown hair; as though conscious of the whiteness
of her face, she would fain cover it until the colour returned. Mr.
Blake-Gordon, a very bad hand at deception at all times, suffered his feelings
to get the better of conventionality now, and burst forth into truth.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Mary! how like this is to the old days! To have you by me alone!--to be
sitting once more together.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Like unto them?&quot; she returned sadly. &quot;No. That can never be.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Would to heaven it could!&quot; he aspirated.</p>
<p>&quot;A strange wish, that, to hear from you now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And, perhaps you think, one I should not have spoken. It is always in my
heart, Mary.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then it ought not to be.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I see,&quot; he said. &quot;You have been hearing tales about me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have heard one tale. I presume it to be a true one. And I--I--&quot; her lips
were trembling grievously--&quot;I wish you both happiness with all my heart.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Blake-Gordon pushed his chair back and began to pace the room restlessly.
At that moment a servant came in with a message to him from her mistress. He
merely nodded a reply, and the girl went away again.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you know what it has all been for me, Mary?&quot; he asked, halting before
her, his brow flushed, his lips just as much agitated as hers. &quot;Do you guess
what it <i>is?</i> Every ray of sunshine went out of my life with you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;At the time you--you may have thought that,&quot; she tremblingly answered. &quot;But
why recall it? The sun has surely begun to shine for you again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Never in this world. Never will it shine as it did then.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nay, but that, in the face of facts, is scarcely credible,&quot; she rejoined,
striving to get up as much calmness, and to speak as quietly, as though Mr.
Blake-Gordon had never been more to her than an acquaintance or friend; nerving
herself to answer him now as such. &quot;You are, I believe, about to&quot;--a cough took
her just there, and she suddenly put her hand to her throat--&quot;marry Agatha.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is true. At least, partially true.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Partially?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;For Heaven's sake, Mary, don't speak to me in that coldly indifferent tone!&quot;
he passionately broke in. &quot;I cannot bear it from you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How would you have me speak?&quot; she asked, rapidly regaining her
self-possession; and her tone was certainly kind, rather than cold, though her
words were redolent of calm reasoning. &quot;The past is past, you know, and
circumstances have entirely changed. It will be better to meet them as such: to
regard them as they are.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, they are changed,&quot; he answered bitterly. &quot;You have made yourself into a
lay-nun----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nay, not that,&quot; she interrupted with a smile.</p>
<p>&quot;A Sister of Charity, then&quot;--pointing to her grey dress. &quot;And I, as the world
says, am to espouse Agatha Mountsorrel.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But surely that is true.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is true in so far as that I have asked her to be my wife: That I should
live to say that to you of another woman, Mary! She has accepted me. But, as to
the marriage, I hope it will not take place yet awhile. <i>I</i> do not press
for it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You shall both have my best and truest prayers for your happiness,&quot; rejoined
Mary, her voice again slightly trembling. &quot;Agatha will make you a good wife. The
world calls her haughty; but she will not be haughty to her husband.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How coolly you can contemplate it!&quot; he cried, in reproach and pain.</p>
<p>Just for one single moment, in her heart's lively anguish, the temptation
assailed her to tell him what it really was to her, and how deeply she loved him
still. She threw it behind her, a faint smile parting her lips.</p>
<p>&quot;William, you know well that what I say is all I can say. I am wedded to the
life I have chosen; you will soon be wedded actually to another than me. Nothing
remains for us in common: save the satisfaction of experiencing good wishes for
the welfare of the other.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is not love, or any feeling akin to it, that has caused me to address
Agatha Mountsorrel----&quot; he was beginning; but she interrupted him with decision.</p>
<p>&quot;I would rather not hear this. It is not right of you to say it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I will say it. Mary, be still. It is but a word or two; and I will have my
way in this. It is in obedience to my father that I have addressed Miss
Mountsorrel. Since the moment when you and I parted, he has never ceased to urge
her upon me, to throw us together in every possible way. I resisted for a long
while; but my nature is weakly yielding--as you have cause to know--and at
length I was badgered into it. Forgive the word, Mary. Badgered by Sir Richard,
until I went to her and said, Will you be my wife? The world had set the rumour
running long before that; but the world was in haste. And now that I have told
you so much, I am thankful. I meant to make the opportunity of telling you had
one not offered: for the worst pain of all, to me, would be, that you should
fancy I could love another. The hearing that I have engaged myself again in this
indecent haste--<i>your</i> hearing it--is enough shame for me.&quot;</p>
<p>The handsome chariot of the Master of Greylands, its fine horses prancing and
curvetting, passed the window and drew up at the house. Mary rose.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope with all my heart that you will love her as you once loved. me,&quot; she
said to him in a half whisper, as she rang the bell and caught up her bonnet.
&quot;To know that, William, will make my own life somewhat less lonely.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did you <i>ever</i> care for me?&quot; broke from him.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. But the past is past.&quot;</p>
<p>He stood in silence while she tied on her grey bonnet, watching her slender
fingers as they trembled with the silk strings. A servant appeared in answer to
the ring. Mary was drawing on her gloves.</p>
<p>&quot;The door,&quot; said Mr. Blake-Gordon.</p>
<p>&quot;Good-bye,&quot; she said to him, holding out her hand.</p>
<p>He wrung it almost to pain. &quot;You will allow me to see you to your carriage?&quot;</p>
<p>She took the arm he held out to her and they went through the hall and down
the steps together. The footman had the carriage door open, and he, her
ex-lover, placed her in. Not another word was spoken. The man sprang up to his
place behind, and the chariot rolled away. For a full minute after its
departure, William Blake-Gordon was still standing looking after it, forgetting
to put his hat on: forgetting, as it seemed, all created things.</p>

<h4><a name="div1_30" href="#div1Ref_30">CHAPTER XXX.</a></h4>
<h5>LOVE'S YOUNG DREAM.</h5>
<br>

<p>Combined With Mr. Walter Dance's remorse for having betrayed to Miss
Castlemaine what he did betray, in that paroxysm of fear when he thought the
world was closing for him, was a wholesome dread of the consequences to himself.
What his father's anger would be and what Mr. Castlemaine's punishment of him
might be, when they should learn all that his foolish tongue had said, Walter
did not care to contemplate. As he lay that night in the Grey Nunnery after the
surgeon's visit, Sister Ann watching by his pallet, he went through nearly as
much agony of fear from this source as he had just gone through from the other.
While he believed his life was in peril, that that mysterious part of him, the
Soul, was about to be summoned to render up its account, earth and earth's
interests were as nothing: utterly lost, indeed, beside that momentous hour
which he thought was at hand. But, after reassurance had set in, and the doctor
had quietly convinced him there was no danger, that he would shortly be well
again, then the worldly fear rose to the surface. Sister Ann assumed that his
starts and turns in the bed arose from bodily pain or restlessness: in point of
fact it was his mind that was tormenting him and would not let him be still.</p>
<p>Of course it was no fault of his that Miss Castlemaine had found him in the
cloistered vaults,--or that he had found her, whichever it might be called--or
that there was a door that he never knew of opening into them, or a passage
between them and the Grey Nunnery, or that the pistol had gone off and shot him.
For all this he could not be blamed. But what he could, and would be blamed for
was, that he had committed the astounding folly of betraying the secret relating
to the Friar's Keep; for it might, so to say, destroy all connected with it.
Hence his resolve to undo, so far as he could, the mischief with Miss
Castlemaine, by denying to her that his disclosure had reason or foundation in
it: and by asserting that it must have been the effect of his disordered brain.</p>
<p>Believing that he had done this, when his morning interview with Sister Mary
Ursula was over: believing that he had convinced her his words had been but the
result of his sick fancies, he began next to ask himself why he need tell the
truth at all, even to his father. The only thing to be accounted for was the
shot to himself and his turning up at the Grey Nunnery: but he might just as
well stand to the tale that he had told the doctor, to his father, as well as to
the world: namely, that he had met with the injury in the chapel ruins, and had
crawled to the Grey Nunnery for succour.</p>
<p>This happy thought he carried out; and Tom Dance was no wiser than other
people. When once deception is entered upon, the course is comparatively easy:
&quot;ce n'est que le premier pas qui coute,&quot; say the French: and Mr. Walter Dance,
truthful and honest though he loved to be, found himself quite an adept at
farce-relating before the first day was over.</p>
<p>Not that Tom Dance, wise in his nearly fifty years, took it all in
unquestioningly. There was something about the story, and about Wally's voice
and face and shifting eyes when he told it, that rather puzzled him: in short,
that created somewhat of a doubt: but the very impossibility (as he looked upon
it) of the injuries having occurred in any other way served to dispel suspicion.
The idea that there was a secret passage from the Friar's Keep to the Grey
Nunnery could no more have entered into Tom Dance's imagination, than that there
was a passage to the moon.</p>
<p>When the indoor hubbub and bustle of the removal of Walter home from the Grey
Nunnery was over, and the numerous friends, admitted one at a time to see him,
had gone again, and Walter had had some refreshing sleep towards sunset, then
Tom Dance thought the time and opportunity had come to have a talk with him. The
old grandmother, Dame Dance--who lived in her solitary abode under the cliff at
some distance, and whose house at high water was not accessible except by
boat--had come up to nurse and tend him, bringing her white apron and a
nightcap. But Tom Dance sent his mother home again. He was a good son, and he
told her that she should not have the trouble: he and Sarah could attend to
Wally without further help. Sarah was his daughter, Walter's sister, and several
years older than the young man. She was a cripple, poor thing, but very useful
in the house; a shy, silent young woman, who could only walk with crutches; so
that Greylands scarcely saw her out of doors from year's end to year's end. Now
and then, on some fine Sunday she would contrive to get to church, but that was
all.</p>
<p>Tom Dance's house was the last in the village and next the beach, its side
windows facing the sea. It was twilight, but there was no candle in Walter's
room yet, and as Tom Dance sat down at the window, he saw the stars coming out
over the grey waters, one by one, and heard the murmuring of the waves.</p>
<p>&quot;D'ye feel that ye could peck a bit, Wally?&quot; asked he, turning his head
sideways towards the bed.</p>
<p>&quot;Sarah's gone to make me some arrowroot, father.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's poor stuff, lad.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's what Dr. Parker said I was to have.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Look here, Wally,&quot; continued Tom, after a pease, during which he had seemed
to be looking out to sea again, &quot;I can't make out what should have taken you up
on to the chapel ruins. Why didn't you follow us to the Hutt?&quot;</p>
<p>To account feasibly for this one particular item in the tale, was Walter's
chief difficulty. He knew that: and while his father was entering upon it in the
morning, had felt truly thankful that they were interrupted.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know <i>what</i> took me,&quot; replied Walter, with a sort of
semi-wonder in his own voice, as though the fact were just as much of a puzzle
to himself as it could be to his father. &quot;I stayed behind to lock up: and the
rest of you had all gone on to the Hutt ever so long: and--and so I went up and
out by the chapel ruins.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;One would think you must ha' been in a dream, lad.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's rare and lonely up that other long passage by oneself,&quot; hazarded
Walter. &quot;You are up at the chapel ruins and out that way in no time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Rare and lonely!&quot; sharply retorted the elder man, as though the words
offended him. &quot;Are you turning coward, lad?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not I, father,&quot; warmly rejoined Walter, perceiving that plea would not find
favour. &quot;Any way, I don't know what it was took me to go up to the chapel ruins.
I went; and that seems to be all about it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was an unpardonable hazardous thing to do. Suppose you had been seen
coming out o' the Keep at that time? And with a pistol!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wish the pistol had been at the bottom o' the sea, I do!&quot; groaned the
invalid.</p>
<p>&quot;What did you take the pistol up for?--why didn't you leave it in the usual
place with the other pistols?&quot; Walter groaned again, &quot;I don't know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tell ye what, lad: but that I know you b'ain't given to drink, I should say
you'd got a drop of the crew's old Hollands into you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Janson did offer me some,&quot; said young Walter, from under the bedclothes.</p>
<p>&quot;And you took it! Well you must ha' been a fool. Why, your grandmother 'ud be
fit to----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wasn't drunk: don't think that father,&quot; interrupted Walter, after a rapid
mental controversy as to whether, of the two evils, it might not be better to
confess to the Hollands--though, in point of fact, he had not touched a drop.
&quot;See here: it's no good talking about it, now it's done and over.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And--if you did get out by wary of the chapel ruins, what on earth made you
go letting off the pistol there?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it was an accident, that was: I didn't go to let it off. That there
wall in the corner knocked again' my elbow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What took you to the corner?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I thought I'd just give a look after the boats that were getting off,&quot; said
Walter, who had spent that day as well as the night, rehearsing difficult items
in his mind. &quot;The beastly pistol went off somehow, and down I dropped.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And of all things,&quot; continued the fisherman, &quot;to think you should ha'
knocked up the Grey Sisters! It must have been Hollands.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was bleeding to death, father. The Grey Nunnery is the nearest place.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, it's not. Nettleby's is the nearest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As if I should go <i>there!</i>&quot; cried Walter, opening his eyes at the bare
suggestion.</p>
<p>&quot;And as near as any is the Hutt. That's where you ought to have come on to.
<i>Why</i> did you not? Come!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I--I--never thought of the Hutt,&quot; said poor Walter, wondering when this
ordeal would be over.</p>
<p>&quot;You hadn't got your head upon you: that's what it was. Wally, lad, I'd
a'most rather see you drownded in the sea some rough day afore my eyes, nor see
you take to drink.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;'Twasn't drink, 'twas the sight of the blood,&quot; deprecatingly returned
Walter. &quot;The Grey Ladies were rare and good to me, father.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That don't excuse your having went there. In two or three minutes more you'd
have reached your home here--and we might ha' kept it all quiet. As it is, every
tongue in the place is a wagging over it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let 'em wag,&quot; suggested Walter. &quot;They can't know nothing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How do you know what they'll find out, with their prying and their
marvelling?&quot; demanded the angry man. &quot;Let 'em wag, indeed!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I could hardly get to the Nunnery,&quot; pleaded Walter. &quot;I thought I was dying.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There'll be a rare fuss about it with the Castlemaines! I know that. Every
knock that has come to the door this blessed day I've took to be the Master o'
Greylands and shook in my shoes. A fine market you'll bring <i>your</i> pigs to,
if you be to go on like this, a getting yourself and everybody else into
trouble! George Hallet, poor fellow, would never have been such a fool.&quot;</p>
<p>Reproached on all sides, self-convicted of worse folly than his father had a
notion of, weak in body, fainting in spirit, and at his very wits' end to ward
off the home questions, Walter ended by bursting into a flood of tears. That
disarmed Tom Dance; and he let the matter drop. Sarah limped in with the
arrowroot, and close upon that Mr. Parker arrived.</p>
<br>

<p>The bright moon, wanting yet some days to its full, shone down on the chapel
ruins. Seated against the high, blank wall of the Grey Nunnery, his sketch-book
before him, his pencil in hand, was Mr. North. He had come there to take the
Friar's Keep by moonlight: at least, the side portion of it that looked that
way. The chapel ruins with its broken walls made the foreground: the half-ruined
Keep, with its Gothic door of entrance, the back; to the right the sketch took
in a bit of the sea. No doubt it would make an attractive picture when done in
watercolours, and one that must bear its own painful interest for George North.</p>
<p>He worked attentively and rapidly, his thoughts meanwhile as busy as his
hands. The moon gave him almost as much light as he would have had by day:
though it cast dark shades as well as brightness; and that would make the chief
beauty of the completed painting.</p>
<p>Somewhere about a week had passed since the accident to Walter Dance, and the
young man was three parts well again.</p>
<p>The occurrence had rarely been out of Mr. North's mind since. He had taken
the opportunity in an easy and natural manner of calling in at Dance's to pay a
visit to the invalid, to inquire after his progress and condole with him; and he
that been struck during that interview with the same idea that had come to him
before--namely, that the story told was not real. Putting a searching question
or two, his eyes intently fixed upon the wounded man's countenance, he was
surprised--or, perhaps not surprised--to see the face flush, the eyes turn away,
the answering words become hesitating. Nothing, however, came of it, save this
impression. Walter parried every question, telling the same tale that he had
told others; but the eyes of the speaker, I say, could not look Mr. North in the
face, the ring of the voice was not true. Mr. North asked this and that; but he
could not ask too pointedly or persistently, his apparent motive being concern
for the accident, slightly tempered with curiosity.</p>
<p>&quot;It was not the ghost of the Grey Friar that shot you, was it?&quot; he questioned
at last with a joking smile. Walter evidently took it in earnest, and shook his
head gravely.</p>
<p>&quot;I never saw the ghost at all, sir, that night: nor thought of it, either. I
was only thinking of the bird.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You did not get the bird, after all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No; he flew away when the pistol went off. It startled him, I know: you
should have heard his wings a-flapping. Father says he'll shoot one the first
opportunity he gets.&quot;</p>
<p>How much was false, and how much true, Mr. North could not discern. So far as
the bird went, he was inclined to believe in it--Walter must have had some
motive for going to the ruins, and, he fancied, a very strong one. It was the
shot itself and the hour of its occurrence that puzzled him. But Mr. North came
away from the interview no wiser than he had entered on it: except that his
doubts were strengthened.</p>
<p>As if to give colouring to, and confirm his son's story, a day or two
subsequent to the accident, Tom Dance, being in the company of some other
fishermen at the time, and having his gun with him, aimed at a large grey
sea-gull that came screeching over their heads, as they stood on the beach, and
brought him down. The next morning, in the face and eyes of all Greylands, he
went marching off with the dead bird to Stilborough, and left it with a
naturalist to be stuffed: and pedestrians passing the naturalist's shop, were
regaled with a sight of Le great bird exhibited there, its wings stretched out
to the uttermost. But it turned out upon inquiry--far people, swayed by their
curiosity, made very close inquiries, and seemed never to tire of doing it--that
the bird had not been <i>ordered</i> by the gentleman at Stilborough, as Walter
Dance was at first understood to say. Dance and his son had intended to make a
present of one to him. As they would now do.</p>
<p>All these matters, with the various speculations they brought in their train,
were swaying Mr. North's mind, as he worked on this evening by moonlight. The
occurrence had certainly spurred up his intention to discover Anthony's fate,
rendering him more earnest in the pursuit. It could not be said that he was not
earnest in it before; but there was nothing he could lay hold of, nothing
tangible. In point of fact, there was not anything now.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you belong to me?&quot; he apostrophised, casting his eyes towards the distant
chimneys of Greylands' Rest, his thoughts having turned on the Master of
Greylands. &quot;Failing poor Anthony to inherit, is the property mine? I would give
much to know. My Uncle James seems too honourable a man to keep what is not his
own: and yet--why did he not show to Anthony the tenure by which he holds the
estate?--why does he not show it now?--for he must know how people talk, and the
doubts that are cast on him. I cannot tell what to think. Personally, I like him
very much; and he is so like----&quot;</p>
<p>A sudden shade fell on Mr. North's book, and made him look up abruptly. It
was caused by a cloud passing over the face of the moon. A succession of light
clouds, this cloud the vanguard of them, came sailing quickly up from beyond the
sea, obscuring, until they should have dispersed, the silvery brightness of the
Queen of night. Mr. North's sketch was, however, nearly done; and a few quick
strokes completed it.</p>
<p>Putting it into his portfolio, he rose, took a look out over the sea, and
passed into the Friar's Keep. Many a time, by night or by day, since his first
arrival at Greylands, had he gone stealthily into that place; but never had
found aught to reward him by sight or sound. Thrice he had explored it with a
light: but he had seen only the monotonous space of pillared cloisters that all
the world might explore at will. Silent and deserted as ever, were they now: and
George North was on the point of turning out again, when the sound of light
footsteps smote on his ear, and he drew back between the wall and the first
pillar near the entrance.</p>
<p>He had left the door wide open--which was, perhaps, an incautious thing to
do--and some rays of moonlight came streaming in. <i>He</i> was in the dark: all
the darker, perhaps, the nook where he stood, from the contrast presented by
these shining rays of light. George North held his breath while he looked and
listened.</p>
<p>Darkening the shining moonlight at the entrance came a woman's figure,
entering far more stealthily and softly than Mr. North had entered. She stole
along amid the pillars, and then stopped suddenly, as though intent on
listening. She was not quite beyond the vision of Mr. North: his eyes were
accustomed to the darkness, and the rays at the open door threw a semi-light
beyond: and he saw her push back her hood and bend her ear to listen. Quite two
minutes passed thus they seemed like five to George North, he standing still and
motionless as the grave. Then she turned, retraced her steps, and went out
again. Mr. North stole to the door in her wake, and looked after her.</p>
<p>Yes, he thought so! It was Jane Hallet. She had gone to the edge now, and was
gazing straight out to seaward, her hands raised over her eyes to steady their
sight. Mr. North knew her only by the outline of her figure, for the hood of her
cloak was well on; but he could not be mistaken. Being about himself of an
evening, he had seen her about; had seen her more than once come to these ruins
and stand as she was standing now: once only before had she entered the Keep.
The precise purport of these manoeuvres he could not fathom, but felt sure that
she was tracking, and yet hiding herself from, Harry Castlemaine. Another
minute, and then she turned.</p>
<p>&quot;Not to-night,&quot; Mr. North heard her say aloud to herself as she passed the
door of the Keep. And she went through the gate and walked rapidly away towards
Greylands.</p>
<p>Mr. North took out his watch to see the time, holding it to the moonlight.
Half-past nine. Not too late, he decided, to go to Greylands' Rest and pay a
short visit to Madame Guise. The family were out that evening, dining at
Stilborough--which information he had picked up from Mrs. Bent: had they been at
home, he would not have thought of presenting himself so late. It might be a
good opportunity to get a few minutes alone with his sister-in-law, and he
wanted to tell her that he had heard from Gap.</p>
<p>Crossing the road, he went striding quickly up the lane, and was nearly run
over by Commodore Teague's spring cart, which came with a bolt unexpectedly out
of the turning. The Commodore, who was driving, did not see him: he had his head
bent down nearly to the off shaft, doing something to the harness. The cart
clattered on its way, and Mr. North pursued his.</p>
<p>Turning in at the gate of Greylands' Rest, and passing round to the broad
path, he heard a voice singing; a voice that he knew and loved too well. Ethel
was not gone to the dinner, then! She sat alone at the piano in the red parlour,
its glass doors being thrown wide open, singing a love ditty to herself in the
moonlight. Mr. North, every pulse of his heart beating with its sense of bliss,
drew himself up against the wall beside the window to listen.</p>
<p>It was a very absurdly-foolish song as to words, just as three parts of the
songs mostly are; but its theme was love, and that was enough for Ethel and for
him; to both the words were no doubt nothing short of sublime. A kind of refrain
followed every verse: the reader shall at least have the benefit of that.</p>
<div style="font-size:smaller">
	<p class="t2">&quot;And if my love prove faithless,</p>
	<p class="t3">What will be left for me?--</p>
	<p class="t2">I'll let him think me scathless,</p>
	<p class="t3">And lay me down and dee.&quot;</div>
<br>

<p>There were five or six verses in the ballad, and these lines came in after
every verse. Ethel had a sweet voice and sang well. Mr. George North stood
against the wall outside, his ears and his heart alike taking in the song, the
words being as distinct as though they were spoken. The final refrain had two
more lines added to it:</p>
<div style="font-size:smaller">
	<p class="t2">&quot;But I know that he is not faithless:</p>
	<p class="t2">He'll be true to me for aye.&quot;</div>
<br>

<p>Ethel left the piano with the last word and came to the window, her bright
face, raised to look at te moon, glowing with a sweet, hopeful expression that
seemed to tell of love.</p>
<div style="font-size:smaller">
	<p class="t2">&quot;But I know that he is not faithless:</p>
	<p class="t2">He'll be true to me for aye.&quot;</div>
<br>

<p>These words were repeated over to herself as she stood; not sung but spoken;
repeated as though she were making the romance her own; as though the words were
a fact, an assurance to herself that somebody would be true to her. George North
went forward, and Ethel was startled.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Mr. North!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;How you frightened me!&quot;</p>
<p>He took her hand--both hands--in his contrition, begging pardon for his
thoughtlessness, and explaining that he waited there until she finished her
song, not to enter and disturb it. It was one of the sweetest moments in the
life of either, this unexpected meeting, all around so redolent of poetry and
romance. Mr. North had to release her hands, but their pulses were thrilling
with the contact.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought you were gone out to dinner,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;No, I was not invited. Only papa and mamma and Harry.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Or of course I should not have attempted to intrude so late as this. I
thought, believing Madame Guise alone, it would be a good opportunity to see
her. I suppose she is at home.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yes; she will be glad to see you,&quot; replied Ethel, her heart beating so
wildly with its love and his presence that she hardly knew what she did say.
&quot;Flora is very troublesome to-night, and Madame has had to go up to her. She
will soon be back again.&quot;</p>
<p>Very troublesome indeed. The young lady, taking the advantage of Mr. and Mrs.
Castlemaine's absence, had chosen to go into one of her wildest moods and
promenade the house en robe de =it. At this present moment she was setting
Madame at defiance from various turns in the staircases, executing a kind of
bo-peep dance.</p>
<p>George North had stepped into the room, and they were standing side by side
at the open window in the moonlight, each perfectly conscious of what the
companionship was to the other. He began telling her where he had been and what
doing; and opened the sketch-book to show her the drawing.</p>
<p>&quot;Sitting in the chapel ruins all that while alone by moonlight!&quot; exclaimed
Ethel. &quot;It is plain you are not a native of Greylands, Mr. North. I question
whether any other man in the place would do it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am not a poor simple fisherman, Ethel,&quot; he laughed. He had called her
&quot;Ethel&quot; some time now, led to it by the example of others at Greylands' Rest.</p>
<p>&quot;I was not thinking altogether of the fishermen. I don't fancy even Harry
Castlemaine would do it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No?&quot; said Mr. North, an amused smile lingering on his</p>
<p>&quot;At least, I have heard him, more than once, express a dislike of the place;
that is, of going to it--had he to do such a thing--after dark. Did you see
anything?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Only----&quot; Mr. North suddenly arrested his words. He had been about to say,
Only Jane Hallet. Various reasons prompted him to close his lips on the point to
Miss Reene.</p>
<p>&quot;Only shadows,&quot; he continued, amending the phrase. &quot;The moon went under a
cloud now and then. It is a most beautiful night out at sea.&quot;</p>
<p>Her slender fingers were trembling as she held one side of the sketch-book,
he holding the other; trembling with sweet emotion. Not a word of his love had
Mr. North said to her; not a word could he say to her under present
circumstances; but Ethel felt that it was hers, hers for all time. Fate might
part them in this life; each, it was possible, might marry apart; but he would
never love another as he loved her.</p>
<p>&quot;How exact it is!&quot; she cried, looking at the page, which the bright clear
moonlight fell upon. &quot;I should know it anywhere. You have even got that one
little dark stone in the middle of the wall that seems to have been put in after
the other stones and is so unlike them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I made it darker that I may know which it is for the painting,&quot; he answered.
&quot;It will make a nice picture.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, very. When shall you paint it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That I don't know. Some of these odd days.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are not painting at all now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No. I don't feel settled enough at the Dolphin for that.&quot;</p>
<p>A pause of silence. In changing the position of his hand, still holding the
book, Mr. North somehow let it touch hers. Ethel's voice trembled slightly when
next she spoke.</p>
<p>&quot;Shall you be going over to France again?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Undoubtedly. In a letter I received this morning from some of my friends
there, they inquire when it is to be. I am lingering here long, they think. It
was to tell Madame Guise I had heard, for she knows them, that brought me here
so late.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You--you said one day, I remember, that you might probably settle in
France,&quot; resumed Ethel, inwardly shivering as she spoke it. &quot;Shall you do so?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is quite uncertain, Ethel. If things turn out as--as they ought to turn,
I should then settle in England. Probably somewhere in this neighbourhood.&quot;</p>
<p>Their eyes met: Ethel looking up, he down. With the yearning love, that sat
in each gaze, was mingled an expression of deep sadness.</p>
<p>&quot;Circumstances at present are so very doubtful,&quot; resumed Mr. North. &quot;They may
turn out well; or very ill----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very ill!&quot; involuntarily interrupted Ethel.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, they may.&quot;</p>
<p>The answer was given in a marked, decisive tone. For the doubt that ran
through his mind--that had run through it much lately--was this: If it should
indeed prove that the Master of Greylands had dealt ill with Anthony, George
North could scarcely bring himself to marry one so closely connected with
Greylands' Rest as Ethel.</p>
<p>&quot;And--in that case?&quot; she continued after a pause, during which he seemed to
have been lost in thought.</p>
<p>&quot;In that case? Oh, I should become a wandering Arab again roaming the world
at large.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And settle eventually in France?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very likely--if I settled anywhere. It is all so uncertain, Ethel, that I
scarcely like to glance at it. I may hold property in England some time: and
that might necessitate my living on it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you mean an estate? Such as this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, such as this,&quot; he answered with a passing, curious smile. &quot;Meanwhile I
am so happy in the present time, in my idle life--transferring some of the
beauties of your country to enrich my portfolio, with the hospitable Dolphin
roof over my head, and the grand, ever-moving sea before me like a glorious
panorama--that I fear I am too willing to forget the future care which may
come.&quot;</p>
<p>Not another word did either speak: the silence, with its pleasure and its
pain, was all too eloquent. The sketch-book was held between them still: and, in
turning over its pages to look at former sketches, their hands could not
help--or, rather, did not help--coming in contact. What bliss it was!</p>
<p>&quot;Why, you are quite in the dark, my dear! Why--dear me! who is it?&quot;</p>
<p>They turned at the voice--that of Madame Guise. She had just left Miss Flora.</p>
<p>&quot;Not in the dark, but in the moonlight,&quot; said Mr. North, holding out his
hand.</p>
<p>&quot;I did not know that you were here,&quot; she answered. &quot;It is late.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very late: I hope you will forgive me. But I have been here some little
time. I was taking a sketch by moonlight not far off, and came on, Madame Guise,
to say Bon jour, thinking you were alone.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is Bon soir, I think,&quot; returned Madame, with a pleasant laugh, as she
rang for lights. &quot;Will you take a chair?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you no,&quot; he replied, putting the sketch-book into the portfolio. &quot;I
will take my departure instead, and call again to-morrow at a more seasonable
hour. Goodnight to you Miss Ethel.&quot;</p>
<p>Ethel put her hand into his and returned the goodnight in a low tone. When he
should have left, the sunshine of the evening would have left with him. Madame
Guise, as she often did, stepped across the threshold to walk to the gate with
him.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you want anything particular with me, George?&quot; she asked in French,
waiting until they were beyond hearing--lest the walls of the house should
possess ears.</p>
<p>&quot;Only to tell you that I had a letter from Emma this morning. I should not
have come up so late but for believing the family were all out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What does Emma say?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not much. Emma never does, you know. She sends some kind messages to you and
a kiss to Marie: and she asks how much longer I mean to linger at Greylands.
That is about all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But does she ask nothing about Anthony?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She asks in a general way, whether we know more yet. Which of course we do
not.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Have you made anything out of that young Dance, George?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing. There's nothing to be made out of him. Except that I feel convinced
the tale he tells is <i>not</i> all true. I was in the Friar's Keep
to-night----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And saw nothing?&quot; she eagerly interrupted.</p>
<p>&quot;And saw nothing. It was dark and silent and lonely as usual. Sometimes I ask
myself what it is that I can reasonably expect to see.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I know; you have thought that from the first,&quot; she said reproachfully.
&quot;<i>My</i> brain is at work always I have no rest by night or by day.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Which is very bad for you, Charlotte: it is wearing you out. This living,
restless anxiety will not bring elucidation any the surer or quicker.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not bring it! But it will. Will my prayers and my anguish not be heard,
think you? God is good.&quot;</p>
<p>They parted with the last words. Charlotte Guise, leaning on the side-gate as
she looked after him, raised her eyes to the blue canopy of heaven: and there
and then, in her simple faith, poured forth a few words of prayer.</p>

<h5>CALLING IN THE BLACKSMITH.</h5>
<br>

<p>Things were swiftly coming to a crisis in Miss Hallet's house, though that
lady was very far from suspecting it. Time had again gone on since the last
chapter, and Walter Dance was about again.</p>
<p>After the evening that witnessed Miss Hallet's fright at the vision of the
Grey Friar, she had been very ill. Whether it was the terror itself, or her
mortification at having betrayed it, or the fall in the road that affected her,
certain it was that she had a somewhat long illness, and was attended by Mr.
Parker. No one could be more attentive to her than Jane was; and Miss Hallet was
willing to forget that the girl had given cause for complaint. But Miss Hallet
found, now that she was well, that the same cause was still in existence: at all
times of unseasonably late hours Jane would be abroad. Scarcely an evening
passed but Jane would make an excuse to go out; or go out without excuse if none
could be framed. She had taken lately to go more to Stilborough, often without
assigning any reason for it. The hour at which she would come in was uncertain;
sometimes it was after ten--a very unhallowed hour in the sober estimation of
her aunt. One night she had stayed out till one o'clock in the morning, sending
Miss Hallet into a perfect fever of suspense and anger. She ran in, panting with
the haste she had made up the cliff, and she looked worn, haggard, almost wild.
Miss Hallet attacked her with some harsh words: Jane responded by a burst of
tears, and declared in a tone of truth that her aunt could scarcely disbelieve,
that she had only been &quot;looking at the sea&quot; and looking at it <i>alone</i>.</p>
<p>From that evening, Miss Hallet had taken to watch Jane as a subject of
curiosity. Jane was getting nervous. More than once when Miss Hallet had gone
upstairs and surprised, unintentionally, Jane in her bedroom--for that lady,
since her illness, had walked about in perfectly noiseless list shoes, for
comfort only, not to come upon people unawares--she had found Jane standing over
a certain open drawer. Jane would shut it hastily and lock it with shaking
fingers, and sometimes shake all over besides. Jane had never been nervous in
her life, mentally reasoned Miss Hallet: why should she be becoming so now? Her
eyes had habitually a strangely-sad look in them, something like those of a
hunted hare; her face was worn and thin. The sudden appearance of anyone at the
door or window would make Jane start and turn pale: she could eat nothing, and
would often be so absorbed in thought as to give contrary answers. &quot;What is the
time by the clock, Jane?&quot; her aunt might say, for instance: &quot;No, aunt, I forgot
it,&quot; might be the answer. Altogether, taking one thing with another, Miss Hallet
came to the conclusion that there was some mystery about Jane, just as certain
other personages of our story decided there was mystery in the Friar's Keep.</p>
<p>The matter troubled Miss Hallet. She knew not what to do, to whom to speak,
or of whom to ask advice. Speaking to Jane herself went for nothing: for the
girl invariably denied, with all the unconcern she could put on, that anything
was amiss or that she was different from what she used to be. It was now that
Miss Hallet felt her isolated position, and the reserve with which she had
treated the village.</p>
<p>Her own illness had left her somewhat less strong-minded than before, or she
would never have spoken of it. One day, however, when Mrs. Bent came up to pay a
social visit, and Jane had gone down the cliff on some necessary errand, Miss
Hallet, who had been &quot;tried&quot; that morning by Jane's having an hysterical fit,
condescended to speak of Harry Castlemaine in connection with her niece, and to
ask Mrs. Bent whether she ever saw them together now.</p>
<p>&quot;Pretty nearly every other evening,&quot; was the plain and most unwelcome answer.</p>
<p>Miss Hallet coughed, to cover a groan of censure. &quot;Where do they walk to?&quot;
she asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Mostly under the high cliff towards the Limpets. It's lonely there at
night--nobody to be met with, ever.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you walk there--that you should see them?&quot; asked keen Miss Hallet.</p>
<p>&quot;To tell you the truth, I have gone there on purpose to see,&quot; was the
landlady's unblushing answer. &quot;I don't approve of it. It's very foolish of
Jane.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Foolish; yes, very: but Jane would never behave lightly!&quot; returned Miss
Hallet, a blush of resentment on her thin cheeks.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't say she would: Jane ought to have better sense than that. But it is
pretty nigh as bad to give rise to talk,&quot; added candid Mrs. Bent: &quot;many a good
name has been tarnished without worse cause. It's not nice news, either, to be
carried up to Greylands' Rest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is it carried there, Mrs. Bent?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Net yet, that I know of. But it will be one of these days. I should put a
summary stop to it, Miss Hallet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; said the unfortunate lady, smoothing her mittened hands together
nervously, as she inwardly wondered how that was to be done, with Jane in her
present temper. And, perplexed with her many difficulties, she began enlarging
upon Jane's new and strange moods, even mentioning the locked drawer she had
surprised Jane at, and openly wondering what she kept in it.</p>
<p>&quot;Love-letters,&quot; curtly observed discerning Mrs. Bent.</p>
<p>&quot;Love-letters!&quot; ejaculated Miss Hallet, who had never had a love-letter in
her life, and looked upon them as no better than slow poison.</p>
<p>&quot;There's not a doubt of it. His. I dare say he has got a lot of Jane's. I
gave her a bit of my mind the day before yesterday, when she came to the inn to
bring back the newspaper,&quot; added Mrs. Bent. &quot;Gave it plainly, too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And--how did Jane receive it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As meek as any lamb. 'I am not the imprudent girl you appear to think me,
Mrs. Bent,' says she, with her cheeks as red as our cock's comb when he has been
fighting. 'Mr. Harry Castlemaine would not like to hear you say this,' she went
on. 'Mr. Harry Castlemaine might lump it,' I answered her. 'It wouldn't affect
him much any way, I expect, Jane Hallet. Mr. Harry Castlemaine might set the sea
afire with a trolley-load of burning tar-barrels if he so minded, and folks
would just wink at him; while you would have the place about your ears if you
dropped in but half a thimbleful.' Jane wished me good morning at that, and
betook herself away.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Bent's visit ended with this. Upon her departure, Miss Hallet put on her
shawl and bonnet and proceeded to take her daily walk outside the door in the
sun, pacing the narrow path from end to end. After Mrs. Bent's information, she
could no longer doubt that Jane's changed mood must be owing to this
acquaintanceship with Mr. Harry Castlemaine. A love affair, of course;--girls
were so idiotic!--and Jane's trouble must arise from the knowledge that it could
end in nothing. So impossible had it seemed to Miss Hallet that Jane, with her
good sense, could really have anything to say, in this way, to the son of the
Master of Greylands, that since the night of the expedition when she had gone
after Jane to watch her, and received her fright as the result, she had suffered
the idea by degrees to drop from her mind: and this revelation of Mrs. Bent's
was as much a shock to her as though she had never had a former hint of it.</p>
<p>&quot;Jane mast have lost her head!&quot; soliloquised the angry lady, her face very
stern. &quot;She must know it cannot come to anything. They stand as far apart as the
two poles. Our family was good in the old days; as good perhaps as that of the
Castlemaines; but things altered with us. And I went out as lady's-maid, for it
was that, not companion, and they know it, and I dare say put me, in their
thoughts, on a level with their own servants. Mr. Castlemaine is polite when he
meets me, and takes his hat off, and sometimes stays to chat for a minute: but
he would no more think my niece a fit wife for his son than he would think the
poorest fisherman's girl in the place fit. Jane <i>must</i> have lost her
senses!&quot;</p>
<p>Miss Hallet stopped to draw her shawl more closely round her, for the wind
was brisk to-day; and then resumed her promenade and her reflections.</p>
<p>&quot;Rather than the folly should continue, I would go direct to the Master of
Greylands, and tell him. He would pretty soon stop it. And I <i>will</i> do it,
if I can make no impression on Jane. I should like to know, though, before
speaking to her, what footing they are upon: whether it is but a foolish fancy
for each other, meaning nothing, or whether she considers it to be more serious.
He cannot have been so dishonourable as to say anything about marriage! At
least, I--I hope not. He might as well offer her the stars: and Jane ought to
know there's as much chance of the one as the other. I wonder what is in the
love-letters?&quot;</p>
<p>Miss Hallet took a turn or two revolving this one point. A wish crossed her
that she could read the letters. She wished it not for curiosity's sake: in
truth, she would not have touched them willingly with a pair of tongs: but that
their contents might guide her own conduct. If the letters really contained
nothing but nonsense--boyish nonsense, Miss Hallet termed it--she might deal
with the matter with Jane alone: but if Mr. Harry had been so absurd as to fill
her up with notions of marriage, why then she would carry the affair up to
Greylands' Rest, and leave it to be dealt with by Greylands' master.</p>
<p>Entering the house, she went upstairs. It was not likely that Jane had left
the drawer unlocked; still it might have happened so, from inadvertence or else.
But no. Miss Hallet stood in Jane's room and pulled at the drawer in question,
which was the first long drawer in the chest. It resisted her efforts. Taking
her own keys from her pocket, she tried every likely one, but none would fit.
Nevertheless, she determined to get those letters on the first opportunity,
believing it to lie in her duty. Not a shade of doubt arose in her mind, as to
Mrs. Bent's clever theory: she was as sure the drawer contained Harry
Castlemaine's love-letters, as though she had it open and saw them lying before
her. Love-letters, and nothing else. What else, was there, that Jane should care
to conceal?</p>
<p>&quot;Jane's instincts are those of a lady,&quot; thought Miss Hallet, looking round
the neat room approvingly at the pretty taste displayed, at the little
ornamental things on the muslin-draped dressing-table. &quot;Yes, they are. And
there's her Bible and Prayer-book on their own stand; and there's--but--dear me!
where on earth did <i>these</i> spring from?&quot;</p>
<p>She had come to a glass of hot-house flowers. Not many. Half a dozen or so;
but they were fresh, and of rare excellence.</p>
<p>&quot;Jane must have brought them in last night. Smuggled them in, I should say,
for I saw none in her hand. It is easy to know where they came from; there's
only one hot-house in the whole place, and that's at Greylands' Rest.&quot;</p>
<p>Miss Hallet went down more vexed than she had come up. She was very precise
and strait-laced: no one could deny that: but here was surely enough food to
disturb her. Just after she had resumed her walk outside, her mind running upon
how she could best contrive to have the drawer opened, and so get at the
love-letters, Jane appeared.</p>
<p>Slowly and wearily was she ascending the cliff, as if she could hardly put
one foot before the other. Miss Hallet could but notice it. Her face was pale;
the one unoccupied arm hung down heavily, the head was bent.</p>
<p>&quot;You look tired to death, Jane! What have you been doing to fatigue yourself
like that?&quot;</p>
<p>Jane started at the salutation, lifted her head, and saw her aunt. As if by
magic, her listless manner changed, and she ran up the short bit of remaining
path briskly. Her pale face had taken quite a glow of colour when she reached
Miss. Hallet.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not tired, aunt. I was only thinking.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thinking of what?&quot; returned Miss Hallett. &quot;You looked and walked as though
you were tired: that's all I know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of something Susan Pike has just told me,&quot; laughed Jane. &quot;It might have
turned out to be no laughing matter, though. Jack Tuff has taken a drop too much
this morning and fallen out of a little boat he got into. Susan says he came up
the beach like a drowned rat.&quot;</p>
<p>Jane went into the house while talking, and put down the basket she had
carried. Miss Hallet followed her.</p>
<p>&quot;I could only get the scrag end this morning, aunt: the best end was sold. So
it must be boiled. And there's the newspaper, aunt: Mrs. Bent ran across to me
with it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Put it on at once, then, with a sliced carrot or two,&quot; said Miss Hallet,
alluding to the meat.</p>
<p>&quot;And bacon,&quot; resumed Jane, &quot;is a halfpenny a pound dearer. I think, aunt, it
would be well to buy a good-sized piece of bacon at Stilborough. I am sure we
give Pike a penny a pound more than we should pay there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well--yes--it might be,&quot; acknowledged Miss Hallet for once: who very rarely
listened to offered suggestions.</p>
<p>&quot;I could bring it back this afternoon,&quot; observed Jane. &quot;What should take you
to Stilborough this afternoon, pray?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I want to take the socks in. And you know, aunt--I told you--that Mrs. Pugh
asked me to go to tea there one day this week: I may as well stay with her
to-day.&quot;</p>
<p>Jane had expected no end of opposition; but Miss Hallet made none. She went
out to walk again without further remark, leaving Jane to the household duties.
It turned out that Susan Pike was going to Stilborough, being also invited to
Mrs. Pugh's. Jane mentioned it to her aunt at dinner, but Miss Hallet answered
nothing.</p>
<p>About four o'clock, that damsel, attired in all the colours of the rainbow
and as gay as a harlequin, came running up the cliff to call for Jane. Jane,
dressed neatly, and looking very nice as usual, was ready for her; and they
started together, Jane carrying her paper of socks and an umbrella.</p>
<p>&quot;Well I never, Jane! you are not a-going to lug along that there big
umbrella, are you?&quot; cried Miss Susan, halting at the threshold, and putting up a
striped parasol the size of a dinner-plate.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not sure about the weather,&quot; returned Jane, looking at the sky. &quot;I
should not like to get wet. What do you think of it, aunt?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think it likely to rain before you are back again: and you will either
take the umbrella, Jane or you will put off that best bonnet for your old one.
What is the matter with the umbrella, Susan Pike?--It will not throw discredit
upon anybody.&quot;</p>
<p>It was, in fact, a handsome, though very large umbrella of green silk, a
present to Jane from Miss Hallet. Susan shrugged her shoulders when they were
out of sight; and Miss Hallet wondered for the hundredth time at Jane's making a
companion of that common, illiterate girl.</p>
<p>She sat down to read the newspaper after they were gone, took her tea, and at
dusk put on her things to go down the cliff. It was a very dull evening, dark
before its time: heavy clouds of lead colour covered the sky. In a rather remote
angle of the village lived the blacksmith, one Joe Brown; a small, silent, sooty
kind of man in a leather apron, who might be seen at his forge from early
morning to late night. He was there now, hammering at a piece of iron, as Miss
Hallet entered.</p>
<p>&quot;Good-evening, Brown.&quot;</p>
<p>Brown looked up at the address, and discerned who the speaker was by the red
glare of his fire--Miss Hallet. He touched his hair in answer, and gave her back
the good-evening.</p>
<p>She told him at once what she wanted, putting her veil aside to speak. The
key of a drawer had been mislaid in her house, and she wished Brown to come and
open it.</p>
<p>&quot;Unlock him, or pick him, mum?&quot; asked Brown.</p>
<p>&quot;Only to unlock it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Won't the morrow do, mum? I be over busy to-night.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, to-morrow will not do,&quot; replied Miss Hallet, in one of those decisive
tones that carry weight. &quot;I want it opened to-night, and you must come at once.
I shall pay you well.&quot;</p>
<p>So the man yielded: saying that in five minutes he would leave his forge, and
be up the cliff almost as soon as she was. He kept his word: and Miss Hallet had
but just got her things off when he arrived, carrying a huge bunch of keys of
various sizes. It was beginning to rain. Not unfrequently was he called out on a
similar errand, and would take with him either these keys, or instruments for
picking a lock, as might be required.</p>
<p>She led the way upstairs to Jane's room, and pointed out the drawer. Brown
stooped to look at the lock, holding the candle close, and at the second trial,
put in a key that turned easily. He drew the drawer a little open to show that
the work was done. Nothing was to be seen but a large sheet of white paper,
covering the drawer half way up. The contents whatever they might be, were under
it.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Miss Hallet, closing the drawer again, while he took the
key off the bunch at her request, to lend her until the morning. &quot;Don't mention
this little matter, Brown, will you be so good,&quot; she added, handing the man a
shilling. &quot;I do not care that my niece or the neighbours should believe me
careless with my keys.&quot; And he readily promised.</p>
<p>The rain was now pouring down in torrents. Miss Hallet stood at the front
door with the man, really sorry that he should have to go through such rain.</p>
<p>&quot;It ain't nothing, mum,&quot; he said. And, taking his leather apron off to throw
over his shoulders, Brown went swinging away.</p>
<p>As the echo of his footsteps, descending the cliff, died away on her ear,
Miss Hallet slipped the bolt of the house-door, and went upstairs again. Putting
the candle down on the white covering; for Miss Hallet and Jane had toilette
covers in their rooms as well as their betters; she opened the drawer again. If
the sheet of white paper covered only love-letters, there must be an astonishing
heap of them: the colour flew into Miss Hallet's cheeks as an idea dawned upon
her that there might be presents besides.</p>
<p>She pulled a chair forward, and drew the candle close to the edge of the
drawers, preparing herself for a long sitting. Not a single letter would she
leave unread: no, nor a single word in any one of them. She was safe for two
good hours, for Jane was not likely to be in before nine: it might not be so
soon as that, if the two girls waited at Stilborough for the storm to cease.</p>
<p>Setting her spectacles on her nose, Miss Hallet lifted the white paper off
the contents of the drawer; and then sat gazing in surprise. There were no
love-letters; no letters of any kind. The bottom of the drawer was lined with
some delicate looking articles, that she took to be dolls' clothes. Pretty
little cambric caps, their borders crimped with a silver knife by Jane's deft
fingers; miniature frocks; small bed-gowns--and such like.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, what on earth!&quot;--began Miss Hallet, after a prolonged perplexity: and
in her bewildered astonishment, she gingerly took up one of the little caps and
turned it about close to her spectacles.</p>
<p>All in a moment, with a rush and a whirl; a rush of dread in her heart, a
whirl of dreadful confusion in her brain; the truth came to the unfortunate
lady. She staggered a step or two back to the waiting chair, and fell down on
it, faint and sick. The appearance of the Grey Friar had brought most grievous
terror to her; but it had not brought the awful dismay of this.</p>
<p>For the dainty wardrobe was not a doll's wardrobe but a baby's.</p>
<br>

<h5>MISS JANE IN TROUBLE.</h5>
<br>

<p>The Grey Ladies held fte sometimes, as well as the outside world; and it was
gay this evening in the Grey Nunnery. The Sisters were en soire: no guests,
however, were present; only themselves. The occasion prompting it was the return
of Sister Mildred: Sister Mildred grown young again, as she laughingly told
them, so sprightly did she feel in her renewed health and strength.</p>
<p>She had brought some treasures back with her: contributed by the kind
relatives with whom she had been staying. A basket of luscious hot-house grapes;
a large, rich, home-made plum-cake; and two bottles of cowslip wine. These good
things had been set out on the table of the parlour, and the whole of the Ladies
sat round, listening to Sister Mildred's glowing accounts of her visit and of
its pleasant doings.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, my dears, they would fain have kept me till next year,&quot; she rejoined in
answer to a remark: and her hearing was for the time so much improved that the
small ear-trumpet, hanging by a ribbon from her waist, was scarcely ever taken
up. &quot;I had a battle, I assure you, to get away. My cousin has two charming
little girls with her, her grandchildren, and the little mites hid the key of my
box, so that it should not be packed; and they cried bitterly when I was ready
to start.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You will be sorry, now, that you have resigned the superiorship to me,&quot;
whispered Mary Ursula, taking up the trumpet to speak. &quot;I will give it back to
you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, my dear, no. I would not be head again for the world. I am better, as
you see, thanks to our merciful Father in heaven; so much better that I can
hardly believe it to be myself; but to keep well I must have no care or trouble.
I shall be of less use here now than any of you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You will be of every use, dear Sister Mildred, if only to help me with
counsel,&quot; returned Mary.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, it is pleasant to be at home again,&quot; resumed the elder lady, her face
beaming from under its crisp muslin cap. &quot;The sojourn with my relatives has been
delightful; but, after all, there's no place like home. And you must give me an
account, dear Sisters of all that has occurred during my absence. See to the
thief in the candle!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There's not very-much to relate, I think,&quot; observed Sister Betsey, as she
attended to the thief. &quot;We had an adventure here, though, one night. Tom Dance's
son went on to the chapel ruins to shoot a sea-bird for somebody at Stilborough,
and his pistol exploded, and wounded him dreadfully. He came crawling here to be
taken in.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you say, dear?&quot; asked Sister Mildred, her hand to her ear. &quot;Tom
Dance brought a sea-bird here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No. His son, young Dance----&quot;</p>
<p>But Sister Betsey's explanation was cut short by a loud, peremptory ring at
the house-bell. Rings at that time of the evening, for it was close upon nine
o'clock, generally betokened notice of illness or accident. Sister Ann hastened
to the door, and the others held their breath.</p>
<p>&quot;Who is ill? Is any case of calamity brought in?&quot; quickly demanded Sister
Mildred on her return.</p>
<p>&quot;No ill case of any kind,&quot; replied Sister Aim, as she approached Mary Ursula.
&quot;It is a visitor for you, madam.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;For me!&quot; exclaimed Mary, feeling surprised. &quot;Is it my uncle--Mr.
Castlemaine?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is Lawyer Knivett, from Stilborough,&quot; said Sister Ann. &quot;His business is
very particular, he says.&quot;</p>
<p>Mary Ursula glanced around as she rose. It would scarcely be convenient for
him to come in amid all the ladies; and she desired Sister Ann to take him to
the dining-room. A cold, bare room it looked, its solitary candle standing at
one end of the dinner-table as she entered. Mr. Knivett came forward and held
out his hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Will you forgive my disturbing you at this time, my dear Miss Castlemaine?&quot;
he asked. &quot;I should have been here an hour or two ago; but first of all I waited
for the violence of the storm to pass; and then, just as I was getting into my
gig, a client came up from a distance, and insisted on an interview. Had I put
off coming until to-morrow morning, if might have been midday before I got
here.&quot;</p>
<p>They were sitting down as he spoke: Mary by the end of the table where the
candle stood: he drew a chair so close in front of her that his knees nearly
touched hers. Mary was inwardly wondering what his visit could relate to. A
curious thought, bringing its latent unpleasantness, crossed her--that it might
have to do with Anthony.</p>
<p>&quot;My dear lady, I am the bearer of some sad news for you,&quot; he began. &quot;People
have said, you know, that a lawyer is like a magpie, a bird of ill-omen.&quot;</p>
<p>She caught up her breath with a sigh of pain. <i>What</i> was it that he had
to tell her?</p>
<p>&quot;It concerns your father's old friend and clerk, Thomas Hill,&quot; went on Mr.
Knivett. &quot;He was your friend too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is he ill?&quot; gasped Mary.</p>
<p>&quot;He was ill, my dear Miss Castlemaine.&quot;</p>
<p>The stress on the one word was so peculiar that the inference seemed all too
plain. Mary rose in agitation.</p>
<p>&quot;Surely--surely he is not dead?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sit down, my dear young lady. I know how grieved you will be; but agitation
will not do any good. He died this afternoon at five o'clock.&quot;</p>
<p>There ensued a silence. Mary's breath was rising in gasps. &quot;And--I--was not
sent for to him,&quot; she cried, greatly agitated.</p>
<p>&quot;There was no time to send,&quot; replied Mr. Knivett. &quot;He had been ailing for
several days past, but the doctor--it was Tillotson--said it was nothing; poor
Hill himself thought it was not. This afternoon a change for the worse occurred,
and I was sent for. There was no time for anything.&quot;</p>
<p>She pushed back the brown hair, braided so simply under the muslin cap. Pale
memories were crowding upon her, mixing themselves up with present pain. The
last time she had seen the surgeon, Tillotson, was the night when her father was
found dead on his sofa, and poor Thomas Hill was mourning over him.</p>
<p>&quot;Hill said more than once to me that he should not last long now his master
Was gone,&quot; resumed the lawyer: &quot;but I thought it was but an old man's talk,
grieving after his many years' master and friend. He was right, however.&quot;</p>
<p>Regrets were stealing upon Mary. She had not, she thought, taken as much
notice of this faithful old man as she ought. Why, oh, why, in that one sole
visit she had made to Stilborough, to Mrs. Ord, did she not call to see him?
These reproaches strike on us all when a friend passes away. The tears were
trickling down her cheeks.</p>
<p>&quot;And I should not have hastened over here to tell you this of itself, Miss
Castlemaine; you'd have heard it soon without that; ill news travels fast. But
nothing can be done without your sanction; hardly the first coffin ordered. You
are left sole executor.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am! Executor!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Executrix, I should have said; but the other word comes more ready. His will
does not contain ten lines, I think, for I made it; and there's not a name
mentioned in it but yours. Every stick and stone is left to you; and sole, full
power in all ways.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But what shall I do, Mr. Knivett? To leave me executor!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My dear young lady, I knew you would be distressed at the first blush of the
thing. I was surprised when he gave me the directions; but he would have it so.
He had a notion, I fancy, that it might serve to take you abroad a bit out of
this place: he did not like your being here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know he did not. I strove to convince him I was happy when he came over
here in the summer; but he could not think it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just so. His money is well and safely invested, and will bring you in about
three hundred and fifty pounds a year. There's some silver, too, and other
knicknacks. It is all yours.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What a good, kind, faithful man he was!&quot; she said, her eyes streaming. &quot;Good
always, in every relation of life. He has gone to his reward.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ay, ay,&quot; nodded Mr. Knivett. &quot;Hill was better than some of his neighbours,
and that's a fact.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I can never act,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;I should not know what to do or how to
do it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My dear Miss Mary, you need not trouble yourself on that score. Give me
power, and I will make it all as easy for you as an old shoe. In fact, I will
act instead of you. Not for gain,&quot; he added impressively: &quot;I must do this little
matter for you for friendship's sake. Nay, my dear, you must meet this as it is
meant: remember my long friendship with your father.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are very kind,&quot; she faltered.</p>
<p>&quot;Have you a pen and ink at hand?&quot;</p>
<p>She brought one, and he caused her to assign to him the necessary power. Then
he asked her wishes as to temporary matters and they consulted for a few minutes
together: but she was glad to leave all to Mr. Knivett that she could leave.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been another death at Stilborough to-day: at least, not more than
a mile or two from it,&quot; observed the lawyer, as he rose to leave. &quot;You have not
heard of it, I suppose?&quot;</p>
<p>He had his back to her as he spoke, having turned to take up his overcoat
which lay on the children's form. Mary replied that she had not heard anything.</p>
<p>&quot;Sir Richard Blake-Gordon's dead.&quot;</p>
<p>A great thump seemed to strike her heart. It stood still, and then went
bounding on again.</p>
<p>&quot;His death was very sudden,&quot; continued the lawyer, still occupied with his
coat. &quot;He fell down in a fit and never spoke again. Never recovered
consciousness at all, Sir William tells me.&quot;</p>
<p>Mary lifted her eyes. Mr. Knivett had turned back to her then.</p>
<p>&quot;Sir--William?&quot; she stammered, feeling confused in all ways. The title was
spoken too suddenly: it sounded strange to her; unnatural.</p>
<p>&quot;It was he who came in and detained me: he had to see me upon an urgent
matter. He is sadly cut up.&quot;</p>
<p>Hardly giving himself time to shake her hand, Mr. Knivett, bustled away. In
passing the parlour-door, Sister Mildred was coming out of it. She and the
lawyer were great friends, though they very rarely saw each other. He could not
stay longer then, he said; and she and Mary went with him to the door, and
walked with him across the waste ground to the gate.</p>
<p>The storm had entirely passed: it was the same evening, told of in the last
chapter, when Miss Hallet took a trip to the blacksmith's: the sky was clear
again and bright with a few stars. The storm had been one of those violent ones
when the rain seems to descend in pitiless torrents. A great gutter of water was
streaming along in front of the Grey Nunnery on the other side the low bank that
divided the path from the road. Mr. Knivett's horse and gig waited in the road
just out of the running water. The night was warm and still, balmy almost as in
summer, though it was getting late in the year. Ten o'clock was striking from
the Nunnery clock.</p>
<p>&quot;I shall be over again in a day or two,&quot; said Mr. Knivett to the ladies, as
he took a leap from the bank over the gutter, and the groom held the apron aside
for him to get up.</p>
<p>The two ladies stood at the gate and watched him drive off. It was, indeed, a
lovely night now, all around quiet and tranquil. Mary, with a sobbing sigh, said
a word to Sister Mildred of the cause that had brought the lawyer over; but the
good Sister heard, as the French say,  tort et  travers. Now, of all queer
items of news, what should the ladies have been pouring into the ex-Superior's
ear during Miss Castlemaine's absence from the parlour, but the unsatisfactory
rumours just now beginning to circulate through the village to the detriment of
Jane Hallet. Her mind full of this, no wonder Sister Mildred was more deaf than
need have been to Mary's words.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a very extraordinary thing, my dear,&quot; she responded to Mary; &quot;and I
think she must have lost her senses.&quot;</p>
<p>At that same moment, sounds, as of fleet footsteps, dawned on Mary's ear in
the stillness of the night. A minute before, a figure might have been seen
flying down the cliffs from the direction of Miss Hallet's dwelling; a panting,
sobbing, crying woman: or rather, girl. She darted across the road, nobody being
about, and made for the path that would take her by the Grey Nunnery. The ladies
turned to her as she came into view. It looked like Jane Hallet. Jane, in her
best things, too. She was weeping aloud; she seemed in desperate distress: and
not until she was flying past the gate did she see the ladies standing there.
Sister Mildred, her head running on what she had heard, glided out of the
gateway to arrest and question her.</p>
<p>&quot;Jane, what is amiss?&quot;</p>
<p>Startled at the sight of the ladies, startled at their accosting her, Jane,
to avoid them, made a spring off the pathway into the road. The bank was
slippery with the rain, and she tried moreover to clear the running stream below
it, just as Mr. Knivett had done. But her foot slipped, and she fell heavily.</p>
<p>Sister Mildred stooped over the bank, and held out her hand. Was Jane
stunned? No: but just for the minute or two she could not stir. She put one hand
to her side as Sister Mildred helped her on to the path. Of no use to try to
escape now.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you hurt, child?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I--I think I am, ma'am,&quot; panted Jane. &quot;I fell on my side.&quot; And she burst
into the sobs again.</p>
<p>&quot;And now tell me what the matter is, and where you were going to.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Anywhere,&quot; sobbed the girl. &quot;My aunt has turned me out of doors?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dear me!&quot; cried Sister Mildred. &quot;When did she turn you out of doors?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now. When I got in from Stilborough. She--she--met me with reproach and
passion. Oh, she is so very violent! She frightened me. I have never seen her so
before.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But where were you running to now?&quot; persisted Sister Mildred. &quot;There, don't
sob in that way.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Anywhere,&quot; repeated Jane, hysterically. &quot;I can sit under a hedge till
morning, and, then go to Stilborough. I am too tired to go back to Stilborough
now.&quot;</p>
<p>Sister Mildred, who had held her firmly by the arm all this time, considered
before she spoke again. Fearing there might be too much cause to condemn the
girl, she yet could not in humanity suffer her to go &quot;anywhere.&quot; Jane was an
especial favourite with all the Sisters. At least, she used to be.</p>
<p>&quot;Come in, child,&quot; she said. &quot;We will take care of you until the morning. And
then--why we must see what is to be done. Your aunt, so, self-contained and calm
a woman, must have had some great cause, I fear, for turning you out.&quot;</p>
<p>Crying, wailing, sobbing, and in a state altogether of strange agitation,
Jane suffered the Sister to lead her indoors, resisting not. Mary Ursula spoke a
kind word or two to encourage her. It was no time for reproach: even if the Grey
Ladies had deemed it their province to administer it.</p>
<p>Jane was shown to a room. One or two beds were always kept made up in the
Grey Nunnery. Sister Betsey, invariably cheerful and pleasant with all the
world, whether they were good or bad, poor or rich, went in with Jane and stayed
to help her undress, chatting while she did it. And so the evening came to an
end, and the house was at length steeped in quietness.</p>
<p>But in the middle of the night an alarm arose. Jane Hallet was ill. Her room
was next to that of Sisters Ann and Phoeby they heard her moaning, and hastened
to her.</p>
<p>&quot;Mercy be good to us!&quot; exclaimed the former, startled out of all equanimity
by what she saw and heard. &quot;We must call the Lady Superior.</p>
<p>&quot;No, no; not her,&quot; corrected the calmer Sister Phoeby. &quot;It is Sister Mildred
who must deal with this.&quot;</p>
<p>So the very unusual expedient was resorted to of disturbing the ex-Superior
in her bed, who was so much older than any of them. Sister Mildred dressed
herself, and proceeded to Jane's room; and then lost not a minute in despatching
a summons for Mr. Parker. He came at once.</p>
<p>At the early dawn of morning the wail of a feeble infant was heard within the
chamber. A small, sickly infant that could not possibly live. The three Sisters
mentioned were alone present. None of the others had been disturbed.</p>
<p>&quot;The baptismal basin,&quot; whispered the elder lady to Sister Ann. &quot;Make haste.&quot;</p>
<p>A china basin of great value that had been an heirloom in the Grant family,
was brought in, half-filled with water. Sister Mildred rose--she had bent for a
minute or two in silent prayer--took the infant in her arms, sprinkled it with
the water, and named it &quot;Jane.&quot; Laying it down gently, those in the room knelt
again. Even Mr. Parker, turning from the bed, put his one knee on a chair.</p>
<p>By the time the Grey Ladies generally rose, all signs and symptoms of bustle
were over. Nothing remained to tell of what the night had brought forth, save
the sick-bed of Jane Hallet, and a dead infant (ushered into the world all too
soon), covered reverently over with a sheet in the corner.</p>
<p>Breakfast done with, Sister Mildred betook herself up the cliff to Miss
Hallet's, her ear-trumpet hanging from her waist-band. It was a painful
interview. Never had the good Sister witnessed more pitiable distress. Miss
Hallet's share in the pomp and pride of life had not been much, perhaps: but
such as it was, it had now passed away from her for ever.</p>
<p>&quot;I had far rather have died,&quot; moaned the poor lady, in her bitter feeling,
her wounded pride. &quot;Could I have died yesterday morning before this dreadful
thing was revealed, I should have been comparatively happy. Heaven hears me say
it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is a sad world,&quot; sighed Sister Mildred, fixing the trumpet to her ear:
&quot;and it is a dreadful thing for Jane to have been drawn into its wickedness. But
we must judge her charitably, Miss Hallet; she is but young.&quot;</p>
<p>Miss Hallet led the Sister upstairs, undid Jane's locked drawer with the
blacksmith's borrowed key, and exhibited its contents as an additional
aggravation in her cup of bitterness. Sister Mildred, a lover of fine work,
could not avoid expressing admiration, as she took up the things one by one.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, they are beautiful!&quot; she cried. &quot;Look at the quality of the lace and
cambric! No gentleman's child could have better things provided than these. Poor
Jane! she must have known well, then, what was coming. And such sewing! She
learnt that from us!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Never, so long as she lives, shall she darken my doors again,&quot; was the
severe answer. &quot;You must fancy what an awful shock it was to me, Sister Mildred,
when I opened this drawer last evening; and what I said to Jane on her entrance,
I really cannot recall. I was out of my mind. Our family has been reduced lower
and lower by ill-fortune; but never yet by disgrace.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sure I can't understand it,&quot; returned the puzzled Sister. &quot;Jane was the
very last girl I could have feared for. Well, well, it cannot be mended now. We
will keep her until she is about again, Miss Hallet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I should put her outside the Nunnery gate to-day!&quot; came the stern reply.</p>
<p>&quot;That would kill her,&quot; said Sister Mildred, shaking her head in compassion.
&quot;And the destroying of her body would not save her soul. The greater the sin,
the greater, remember, was the mercy of our Lord and Master.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She can never hold up her head in this world again. And for myself, as I
say, I would far rather be dead than live.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She won't hold it up as she has held it: it is not to be expected,&quot; assented
Sister Mildred with an emphatic nod. &quot;But--well--we must see what can be done
with her when she's better. Will you come to see her, Miss Hallet?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<i>I</i> come to see her!&quot; repeated the indignant relative, feeling the
proposal as nothing less than an outrage. &quot;I would not come to see her if she
lay dying. Unless it were to reproach her with her shame.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are all hardness now,&quot; said indulgent Sister Mildred, &quot;and perhaps I
should be in your place: I know what a bitter blow it is. But the anguish will
subside. Time heals the worst sores: and, the more we are weaned from this
world, the nearer we draw to Heaven.&quot;</p>
<p>She dropped her trumpet, held Miss Hallet's hand in hers, and turned to
depart. That ruffled lady, after escorting her to the door, turned the key and
shot the bolt, as if she wanted to have no more to do with the outer world, and
would fain deny it entrance.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh ma'am, what a sight o' news is this!&quot; broke forth staring Nancy Gleason,
meeting the Grey Lady face to face at a sudden turning of the cliff path, and
lifting her two hands in reprobation.</p>
<p>It was the first instalment of the public unpleasantness: an unpleasantness
that must perforce arise, and could only be met. Of no use for Sister Mildred to
say &quot;What do you mean?&quot; or &quot;Jane Hallet is nothing to you.&quot; The miserable news
had gone flying about the village from end to end: it could neither be arrested
nor the comments on it checked.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't stay talking this morning, Nancy Gleeson,&quot; replied the deaf lady;
who guessed, more than heard, what the theme must be. &quot;You had better go home to
your little ones; they may be setting themselves on fire again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;'Twarn't so over long ago she was a lugging our Bessy up the path, and she
looked fit to drop over it; all her breath gone, and her face the colour o'
chalk,&quot; continued Nancy, disregarding the injunction. &quot;Seemed to me, ma'am, then
as if 'twas odd. Well, who'd ever ha' thought it o' Miss Jane Hallet?&quot;</p>
<p>Sister Mildred was yards away, and Nancy Gleeson's words were wasted on the
air. At the foot of the cliff, as she was crossing the road, Mrs. Bent saw her
from the inn door, and came over with a solemn face.</p>
<p>&quot;How is she doing?&quot; asked the landlady, speaking close to Sister Mildred's
ear.</p>
<p>&quot;Pretty well.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I shall never be surprised at anything after this, ma'am; never: When Molly,
all agape, brought the news in this morning, I could have sent a plate at her
head, for repeating what I thought was nothing but impossible scandal. Miss
Hallet must be fit to hang herself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is a sad, grievous thing for all parties, Mrs. Bent,&quot; spoke Sister
Mildred. &quot;Especially for Jane herself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;One can't help pitying her, poor young thing. To have blighted her life at
her age! And anything that's wanted for her while she's sick, that the Nunnery
may be out of, please send over to me for. She's heartily welcome to it, Sister
Mildred.&quot;</p>
<p>The Sister nodded her thanks, and walked on. Mr. Parker overtook her at the
Nunnery door, and they went up together to the sick-room.</p>
<p>Jane lay, white and wan, on the pillow, Sister Mona standing by her side. She
looked so still and colourless that for the moment it might have been thought
she was dead. Their entrance, however, caused her eyes to open; and then a faint
shade of pink tinged her face.</p>
<p>Mr. Parker ordered some refreshment to be administered; and Sister Mona left
to get it. &quot;See that she has it at once,&quot; he said, speaking into the trumpet. &quot;I
am in a hurry just now, and cannot stay.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is anyone ill?&quot; asked Sister Mildred.</p>
<p>&quot;A child up at the coastguard station is in convulsions, and they have sent
for me in haste. Good-morning, madam, for the present. I'll call in on my
return.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Only one moment, doctor,&quot; cried Sister Mildred, following him out to the
corridor, and speaking in a whisper. &quot;Is Jane in danger?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, I think not. She must be kept quiet.&quot;</p>
<p>Infinitely to the astonishment of Sister Mildred, somewhat to her scandal,
Mr. Harry Castlemaine appeared on the staircase, close upon the descent of the
doctor. He must have come into the Nunnery as the latter let himself out. Taking
off his hat, he advanced straight to Sister Mildred, the open door at which she
was standing no doubt indicating to him the sick-room.</p>
<p>&quot;By your leave, Sister Mildred,&quot; he said, with a grave and pleasant
smile--and passed in.</p>
<p>She was too utterly astonished to stop him. But she followed him in, and laid
her arresting hand on his arm.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Harry--Harry Castlemaine, what do you mean by this? Do you think, sir, I
can allow it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I <i>must</i> speak a word or two to Jane,&quot; he whispered in her ear,
catching up the trumpet of his own accord. &quot;Dear lady, be charitable, and leave
me with her just for a minute, On my honour, my stay shall not much exceed
that.&quot; And, partly through his persuasive voice, and smile, and hands, for he
gently forced her to the door, partly in her own anxiety to obey the doctor's
injunction of keeping Jane quiet, and wholly because she felt bewildered and
helpless, Sister Mildred found herself outside in the corridor again, the door
shut behind her.</p>
<p>&quot;My goodness!&quot; cried the perplexed lady to herself. &quot;It's well it's me that's
here, and not the younger Sisters.&quot;</p>
<p>In two minutes, or little more, he came out again; his hand held forth.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, dear Sister Mildred. I thank you from my heart.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, I cannot take it,&quot; she said, turning pointedly away from his proffered
hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you so offended that I should have come in!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not at that: though it is wrong. You know why I cannot touch your hand in
friendship, Harry Castlemaine.&quot;</p>
<p>He stood a moment as though about to reply; but closed his lips without
making any. &quot;God bless you, dear lady; you are all very good: I don't know what
Greylands would do without you. And--please&quot;--he added, turning back again a
step or two.</p>
<p>&quot;Please what?&quot; demanded Sister Mildred.</p>
<p>&quot;Do not blame <i>her</i>. She does not deserve it. I do.&quot;</p>
<p>He went softly down the stairs and let himself out. John Bent was standing at
his door as Harry came in view of the Dolphin, and the young man crossed over.
But, when he got up, John had disappeared indoors. There was no mistaking that
the movement was intentional, or the feeling that caused the landlord to shun
him. Harry Castlemaine stood still by the bench, evidently very much annoyed.
Presently he began to whistle, slowly and softly, a habit of his when in deep
thought, and looked up and down the road, as if uncertain which way he should
take.</p>
<p>A knot of fishermen had gathered round the small boats on the beach, and were
talking together less lazily than usual: possibly, and indeed probably, their
exciting theme was the morning's news. One of them detached himself from the
rest and came up towards the Dolphin, remarking that he was going to &quot;wet his
whistle.&quot; Mr. Tim Gleeson in a blue nightcap.</p>
<p>To judge by his flushed face and his not altogether steady gait, the whistle
had been wetted already. When he saw Mr. Harry Castlemaine standing there, he
came straight up to him, touching his cap. That trifling mark of respect he did
observe: but when he had got a glass within him, there was no such
hail-fellow-well-met in all Greylands as Tim Gleeson. He would have accosted Mr.
Castlemaine himself.</p>
<p>&quot;In with the tide, Gleeson?&quot; remarked Harry--who was always pleasant with the
men.</p>
<p>&quot;Her's just gone out, sir,&quot; returned Gleeson, alluding to the boat. &quot;I didn't
go in her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Missed her, eh?&quot; A misfortune Mr. Gleeson often met with.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I did miss of her, as might be said. I was a-talking over the news,
Mr. Harry, with Tuff and one or two on 'em, and her went and put off without
me.&quot;</p>
<p>Harry wondered he was not turned off the boat altogether. But he said
nothing: he ceased to take notice of the man, and resumed his whistling.
Gleeson, however, chose to enter upon the subject of the &quot;news,&quot; and applied a
hard word to Jane.</p>
<p>Harry's eagle glance was turned on the man like lightning. &quot;What is that,
Gleeson?&quot; he asked, in a quiet but imperious tone.</p>
<p>And Mr. Tim Gleeson, owing no doubt to the wetting of the whistle, was so
imprudent as to repeat it.</p>
<p>The next moment he seemed to have pins and needles in his eyes, and found
himself flat on the ground. Struck to it by the stern hand of Mr. Harry
Castlemaine.</p>

<h4><a name="div1_33" href="#div1Ref_33">CHAPTER XXXIII.</a></h4>
<h5>A TURBULENT SEA.</h5>
<br>

<p>Boisterous weather. Ethel Reene, her scarlet cloak on, and her hat tied
securely over her ears, was making her way to the top of the cliff opposite the
coastguard station. A somewhat adventurous expedition in such a wind; but Ethel
was well used to the path. She sat down when she reached the top: <i>dropped</i>
down, laughing heartily. For the blast seized rudely on her petticoats, and sent
the silken cords and tassels of her cloak flying in the air.</p>
<p>A glorious sea. A sea to look at to-day: to excite awe; to impress the mind
with the marvellous works of the Great Creator. &quot;Hitherto shalt thou come, but
no farther. And here shall thy proud waves be stayed.&quot;</p>
<p>The waves were leaping mountains high; the foam and spray dashed aloft; the
sound of the roar was like prolonged thunder. Ethel sat with clasped hands and
sobered face and heart, lost in contemplation of the Majesty seen and unseen. It
was not the time for silent thought to-day, or for telling her secrets to the
sea: wonder, praise, awe, they could alone fill the mind.</p>
<p>&quot;What a grand scene!&quot;</p>
<p>The words were spoken close to her ear, and she turned her head quickly,
holding her hat. The fastenings of her hair had blown away, and it fell around
her in a wave of curls. Mr. North was the speaker. He had made his way up the
rocks to watch this wondrous sea from that elevated place, not suspecting any
one was there.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not think I ever saw it so rough as this,&quot; said Ethel, as he took her
hand in greeting, and then sat down beside her.</p>
<p>&quot;I never saw it half as rough; never: but it has not been my privilege to
live near the sea,&quot; he answered. &quot;Are you sure it is safe for you to sit here,
Ethel?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yes. I am ever so far from the edge, you see.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I do not know,&quot; he doubtingly answered; &quot;the blast is strong. Mr. and Mrs.
Castlemaine might warn you away, did they see you here.&quot;</p>
<p>As if to impart weight to his words, a furious gust came sweeping along and
over them. Ethel caught involuntarily to the hard ground, and bent her head
down. Mr. North hastily put his arm round her for protection.</p>
<p>&quot;You see, Ethel!&quot; he spoke when the rush had subsided. &quot;It is dangerous for
you. Had I not been here, you might have been blown away.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, no; but--perhaps--I should not have remained after that. I do not think
it was ever so fiercely rough.&quot;</p>
<p>As he was there, however, and holding her securely, she made no movement to
go. Ah, how could she! was it not all too delicious!--bliss unutterable!--and
the wind was such an excuse. In after years, whether for her they might be long
or short, Ethel would never lose the remembrance of this hour. The panorama of
that turbulent sea would be one of her mind's standing pictures; the clasp of
his arm never cease, when recalled, to cause her heart to thrill.</p>
<p>They sat on, close together, speaking but a stray word now and then, for it
was nearly as difficult to hear anything said as it would have been for deaf
Sister Mildred. By-and-by, as if the wind wanted a temporary rest, its worst
fury seemed abated.</p>
<p>&quot;I wonder if I could sketch the sea?&quot; cried Mr. North. &quot;Perhaps I could: if
you will help me to hold the book, Ethel.&quot;</p>
<p>He had his small sketch-book in his pocket: indeed he rarely went out without
it: and he drew it forth. Ethel held the leaves down on one side the opened
page, and he on the other: with his other hand he rapidly took the lines of the
horizon before him, and depicted the mountainous billows of the raging sea. Just
a few bold strokes--and: he left the rest to be filled in at a calmer season.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you that is enough,&quot; he said to Ethel. But it took both their efforts
to close the book again securely. The wind had all but torn its pages out; a
lawful prey.</p>
<p>&quot;There are people existing who hate never seen the sea,&quot; remarked Ethel. &quot;I
wonder if they can form even a faint conception of the scene it presents on such
a day as this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thousands and thousands have never seen it,&quot; said Mr. North. &quot;Perhaps
millions, taking the world from Pole to Pole.&quot;</p>
<p>Ethel laughed at a thought that came to her. &quot;Do you know, Mr. North, there
is an old woman at Stilborough who has never seen it. She has never in her life
been as far as Greylands--only three miles.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is scarcely believable.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No: but it is true. It is old Mrs. Fordham. Her two daughters kept a cotton
and tape shop in New Street. They sell fishing-tackle, too, and writing-paper,
and many other things. If you choose to go and ask Mrs. Fordham, for yourself,
she would tell you she has never had the curiosity to come as far as as this to
see the sea.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But why?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;For no reason, she says, except that she has always been a great
stay-at-home. She had a good many children for one thing, and they took up all
the time of her best years.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I should like to charter a gig and bring the old lady to see it to-day,&quot;
exclaimed Mr. North. &quot;I wonder whether she would be astonished?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She would run away frightened,&quot; said Ethel, laughing. &quot;Will you please to
tell me what the time is?&quot;</p>
<p>He took out his watch. It was past twelve o'clock; and Ethel had to go. Mr.
North drew her hand within his arm, seemingly as a matter of course, remarking
that he must pilot her down the cliff. Ethel's face was covered with blushes.
She was too timid to withdraw her hand: but she thought what would become of her
should Mr. or Mrs. Castlemaine meet them. Or even Madame! So they went on
arm-in-arm.</p>
<p>&quot;Should I make anything of this sketch,&quot; said Mr. North, touching his pocket
that contained the book; &quot;anything of a watercolour I mean, it shall be yours,
if you accept it. A memento of this morning.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; murmured Ethel, her lovely face all blushes again.</p>
<p>&quot;You will think of me perhaps when you look at it--once in a way. I may be
far away: divided from you by sea and land.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are you going so soon?&quot; she stammered.</p>
<p>&quot;I fear I shall have to go eventually. The--the business that is keeping me
here does not advance at all; neither does it seem likely to.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is business keeping you here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I had no idea of that. Of what nature?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is partly connected with property.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The property that you told me might come to you by inheritance?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. The coming seems very far off, though; farther than ever: and I--I am
doing myself no good by staying.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No good!&quot; exclaimed Ethel, in surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;In one sense I am not: individually, I am not. For, each day that I stay
will only serve to render the pain of departing more intolerable.&quot;</p>
<p>Their eyes met. Ethel was at no loss to understand. Whether he meant her to
or not he could scarcely have decided. But for exercising some self-control, he
must have spoken out plainly. And yet, to what end? This fair girl might never
become more to him than she was now, and their mutual love would be flung away
to die on the shoals of adverse fate; as three parts of first love is in this
world.</p>
<p>He released her when they were on level ground, and walked side by side with
her as far as Chapel Lane, Ethel's way home to-day. There they stood to shake
hands.</p>
<p>&quot;I wonder if we shall ever again sit together watching a sea such as this has
been!&quot; he said, retaining her hand, and gazing down at her conscious face.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not get a sea like this above once or twice a year.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No. And when you get it next, nothing may be left of me here but the memory.
Good-bye, Ethel.&quot;</p>
<p>She made her way homewards as swiftly as the wind would allow. Mr. North,
somewhat sheltered under the lee of the Grey Nunnery, once he had passed the
open chapel ruins, gave his mind up to thought. The little school-children,
protected by the walls of the high building, were playing on the waste ground at
&quot;You can't catch me.&quot;</p>
<p>His position had begun to cause him very serious reflection: in fact, to
worry him. Nothing could be more uncertain than it was, nothing more
unsatisfactory. Should it turn out that Mr. Castlemaine had had any hand in
injuring Anthony--in killing him, in short--why, then George North must give up
all hope of Ethel. Ethel was to Mr. Castlemaine as a daughter, and that would be
a sufficient bar to George North's making her his wife. Long and long ago would
he have declared himself to the Master of Greylands but for Charlotte Guise; he
would go to him that very day, but for her, and say, &quot;I am your nephew, sir,
George Castlemaine:&quot; and ask him candidly what he had done with Anthony. But
only the bare mention of this presupposed line of conduct would upset poor
Madame Guise utterly: she had implored, entreated, <i>commanded</i> him to be
silent. He might go away from Greylands, she said, and leave all the
investigation to her; she did not want him to stay; but to spoil every chance of
tracing out Anthony's fate--and, as she believed, that would spoil it--was not
to be heard of. This chafed Mr. North's spirit somewhat: but he felt that he
could not act in defiance of his brother's widow. The morning's interview on the
cliff with Ethel had not tended to lessen the uneasiness and embarrassments of
his position, but rather to bring them more clearly before him.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be something gained if I could only ascertain how the estate was
really left,&quot; he said to himself as he glanced mechanically at the shouting
children; just as so many others, including his unfortunate brother, had said
before him. &quot;If it be, de facto, my Uncle James's, why he could have had no
motive for wishing Anthony out of the way: if it was left to my father, why then
it was absolutely Anthony's, and the Uncle James was but a usurper. In that
case--but it is very hard to think so ill of him. I wonder whether--&quot; Mr. North
made a pause to revolve the question--&quot;whether I could get anything out of
Knivett?&quot;</p>
<p>Deep in, thought, the Nunnery passed, he unguardedly approached the open part
by the beach. Whirr!--whew! His hat went one way, the skirts of his coat
another. The latter, not being detached, had to return to their places; but the
hat was nowhere.</p>
<p>Harry Castlemaine, chancing to pass, ran and caught it, and brought it,
laughing, to Mr. North. The young men liked each other and were cordial when
they met; but they had not advanced to intimacy. Each had his reasons for
avoiding it: Harry Castlemaine never chose to become to friendly with any
stranger sojourning at Greylands; George North, under his present pseudo aspect,
rather shunned the Castlemaines.</p>
<p>&quot;It is well heads are not loose, as well as hats, or they'd be gone to-day,&quot;
said Harry, giving up the hat. &quot;Where's your ribbon?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It had come unfastened from my buttonhole. Thank you. What a grand sea it
is!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wonderful. A rare sea, even for Greylands. Good-day.&quot;</p>
<p>Like a great many more of us, Mr. North sometimes did things upon impulse. As
he crossed to the Dolphin, holding Ins hat on his head, the two-horse van came
lumbering down the hill by the Nunnery on its way to Stilborough. Impulse--it
certainly was not reason--induced George North to get inside and go off with it.
In due course of time it conveyed him to Stilborough.</p>
<p>&quot;Can you tell me where Mr. Knivett, the advocate, lives?&quot; he asked of the
driver when he was paying his fare.</p>
<p>&quot;Lawyer Knivett, is it, sir, that you want? He lives close to the
market-house, in the centre of the town.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Which is my way to it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Go to the end of the street, sir: take the first turning on the left, New
Street, and that will bring you into the street where the marketplace is.
Anybody will tell you which is Lawyer Knivett's.&quot;</p>
<p>Just as in the days, some months gone by, poor Anthony had been directed to
the lawyer's house, and readily found it, so did the younger brother find it
now. The brass-plate on the door, &quot;Mr. Knivett, attorney-at-law,&quot; stared him in
the face as he halted there. During the dinner-hour, between half-past one and
two, this outer door was always shut; an intimation that clients were not wanted
to call just then: at other times it was generally, though not invariably, open:
impatient clients would often give it a bang behind them in escaping. Mr. North
rang the bell, and was admitted to the clerk's room, where a young man, with
curled black hair and a nose like a parrot's, sat behind a desk near the window,
writing.</p>
<p>&quot;Can I see Mr. Knivett?&quot; asked George.</p>
<p>The young man stretched his neck forward to take a look at the applicant.
&quot;It's not office-hours,&quot; said he in answer, his tone superlatively distant.</p>
<p>&quot;When will it be office-hours?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;After two o'clock.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can I see him then--if I wait?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, yes, I suppose you can. There's a chair&quot;--extending the feather-end of
his pen to point it out: which caused the diamond ring he wore on his finger to
flash in the sunlight.</p>
<p>&quot;A vain young dandy,&quot; thought George, as he sat down, regarding the ring, and
the curled hair, and the unexceptionable white linen. The gentleman was, in
fact, a distant relative of Squire Dobie's, holding himself to be far above all
the fraternity of men of the law, and deeming it an extremely hard case that his
friends should have put him into it.</p>
<p>The silence broken only by the scratching of the pen, was interrupted by the
sudden stopping before the house of a horse and gig. An active little gentleman
of middle-age leaped out, came in, and opened the door of the room.</p>
<p>&quot;Where's Mr. Knivett, Dobie? At his dinner?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>Away went the little gentleman somewhere further on in the house. Almost
immediately he was back again, and Mr. Knivett with him. The latter opened the
door.</p>
<p>&quot;I am going out, Mr. Dobie. Don't know how long I may be detained. Old Mr.
Seaton's taken ill.&quot; And, with that, he followed the little gentleman out,
mounted the gig with him, and was gone.</p>
<p>It had all passed so quickly that George North had not space to get in a
word. He supposed his chance of seeing the lawyer for that day was at an end.</p>
<p>Scarcely had the gig driven off, and Mr. Dobie brought back his head from
gazing after it over the window blind, when there entered a gentleman in deep
mourning: a good-looking man with a somewhat sad countenance. Mr. Dobie got off
his stool with alacrity, and came forward.</p>
<p>&quot;How are you, Sir William?&quot;</p>
<p>Sir William Blake-Gordon--for it was he--returned the greeting: the two young
men met occasionally in society.</p>
<p>&quot;Can I see Mr. Knivett?&quot; asked Sir William.</p>
<p>&quot;No, that you can't,&quot; returned the gentleman-clerk. &quot;Charles Seaton of the
Hill has just fetched him out in a desperate hurry. Knivett, going out to the
gig, put in his head to tell me old Seaton was taken ill. Wants his will
altered, I suppose.&quot;</p>
<p>Sir William considered. &quot;Tell Mr. Knivett, then, that I will be here at about
eleven o'clock to-morrow. I wish to see him particularly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All right,&quot; said Mr. Dobie.</p>
<p>Sir William was turning away, when his eyes fell on George North, who had
then risen preparatory to departure. He held out his hand cordially, and George
North met it. A week or two previously, just before Sir Richard's death, it
chanced that they had met at a country inn, and were detained there part of a
day by a prolonged storm of rain and thunder. Each had liked the other, and
quick acquaintanceship had been formed.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you still at Greylands, Mr. North?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, do not forget that I shall be very glad to see you. Come over at any
time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; replied George.</p>
<p>The new baronet went out. Mr. Dobie, witnessing all this, began to fancy that
the gentleman might be somebody worth being civil to.</p>
<p>&quot;I am sorry Knivett should have started off in this sudden way,&quot; he observed,
his tone changed to ease, &quot;but I suppose there was no help for it. Is there
anything I can do for you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; returned George, &quot;I fear not. I merely wanted to ask Mr. Knivett a
question about a family in the neighbourhood.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I dare say I could answer it,&quot; said Mr. Dobie. &quot;I know all the best families
as well as Knivett does, or better: been brought up among them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you know the Castlemaines?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I ought to. My relatives, the Dobies of Dobie Hall, and the Greylands'
Rest people used to be as thick as inkleweavers. Harry Castlemaine is one of my
friends.&quot;</p>
<p>George North paused. An idea struck him that perhaps this young man might be
able to give him some information: and, to tell the truth, though he had come to
ask Mr. Knivett to do it, he had very little hope that the lawyer would. At
least there would be no harm in his putting the question.</p>
<p>&quot;I am a stranger here,&quot; he said. &quot;Until some weeks back I never was in this
part of the world or knew a soul that inhabited it. But I have become acquainted
with a few people; and, amidst them, with the Castlemaines. Did you know the old
grandfather, Anthony?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just as well as I know my own grandfather.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Greylands' Rest was his, I fancy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course it was.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To whom did he leave it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, that's a question,&quot; said Mr. Dobie, taking his penknife out to trim the
top of one of his filbert nails. &quot;There was a nephew made his unexpected
appearance on the estate last winter--a son of the elder brother----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have heard,&quot; interrupted George North: &quot;Anthony Castlemaine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just so. Well, he thought Greylands' Rest was his; wanted to put in a claim
to it; but Mr. Castlemaine wouldn't allow it at any price. The claimant
disappeared in some queer manner--you have no doubt heard of it--and James
Castlemaine retains undisturbed possession. Which is said to be nine points of
the law, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then, you do not know how it was left? whether it is legally his?&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Dobie shook his head. &quot;I'd not like to bet upon it, either way. If forced
to do so, I'd lay it against him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You think it was left to Anthony Castlemaine,&quot; said George North quickly.
&quot;That is, to Anthony's father; Basil, the eldest brother.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What I think is, that if Mr. Castlemaine could show he had any right to it,
he would show it, and put an end to the bother,&quot; spoke Mr. Dobie.</p>
<p>&quot;But he should be made to do this.&quot;</p>
<p>The clerk lifted his eyes from his nails, his eyebrows raised in surprise.
&quot;Who is to make him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sure I don't know. Could not the law?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The law must get a leg to stand upon before it can act. It has no right to
interfere with Mr. Castlemaine. That young Anthony--if he's not dead--might come
back and enter a process against him for restitution, and all that: in that case
James Castlemaine would have to show by what tenure he holds it. But it might be
an awfully long and expensive affair; and perhaps end in nothing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;End in nothing?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, you see, if old Anthony Castlemaine simply made a present, while he was
yet living, of Greylands' Rest to James, the latter would have to swear to it,
and the thing would be done with. Some people think it was so. Others, and I for
one, don't fancy it was his at all, but that poor young Anthony's.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Castlemaines have always been held to be men of honour, I believe?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And we should never have doubted James to be one--but for his refusal to
satisfy his nephew and the public. Nothing but that raised a doubt against him.
It is blowing over now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You do not know, then, how Greylands' Rest was left, or to whom?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No. I don't believe anybody does know, save Mr. Castlemaine himself. Unless
it's Knivett. He may.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I dare say Knivett would not tell--even if he were pumped.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Dobie burst into a laugh at the idea. &quot;Knivett tell the affairs of any of
his clients!&quot; said he. &quot;You might as well set on and pump this high-backed chair
as pump him.&quot;</p>
<p>The clerks, two of them, came in from dinner, and no more was said. George
North walked back to Greylands, having taken nothing by his journey: just as the
unfortunate Anthony had walked back to it many months before. The wind was
blowing worse than ever. Several people, chiefly women, had gathered on the
beach to look at the sea; but the spray and the roar nearly blinded and deafened
them. Amidst others stood Mrs. Castlemaine, Ethel, and Flora: talking to them
was the landlady of the Dolphin, a huge shawl tied over her head. George North
approached.</p>
<p>&quot;It is surely worse than it was this morning!&quot; said George, after speaking to
the ladies.</p>
<p>&quot;And what'll it be when the tide is full up again!&quot; cried Mrs. Bent, whose
tongue was ever of the readiest. &quot;Twenty years I've lived in this place, and
never saw it like this. Look at that wave!--My patience!&quot;</p>
<p>Almost as the words left her lips, there arose a cry of alarm. The wave,
rearing itself to a towering height, came dashing in on the beach nearer than
was bargained for, and engulfed Miss Flora Castlemaine. That young damsel, in
defiance of commands, had been amusing herself by running forward to meet the
waves and running back again before the water could catch her. This time she had
not been quite so successful. The force of the water threw her down; and even as
they looked, in the first moment of alarm, they saw her drifting rapidly out to
sea with the returning tide.</p>
<p>Mrs. Castlemaine shrieked wildly. Nearly everybody shrieked. Some ran here,
some yonder; some laid hold of one another in the nervousness induced by terror:
and the child was being washed further out all the while. But the cries suddenly
ceased; breaths were held in suspense: for one was going out to the rescue.</p>
<p>It was George North. Flinging off his coat and hat, he dashed through the
waves, keeping his footing as long as he could, battling with the incoming tide.
But for the boisterous state of the sea, the rescue would have been mere child's
play; as it was, it cost him some work to reach and save her. He bore her back,
out of the cruel water. She was quite insensible.</p>
<p>Ethel burst into tears. In the moment's agitation, she was not sure but she
clasped his arm, wet as he was, when striving to pour forth her thanks. &quot;Oh, how
brave you are! How shall we ever repay you!&quot;</p>
<p>He snatched a moment to look back into her eyes, to give her a smile that
perhaps said all too much, and went on with his dripping burden. &quot;To my house!&quot;
cried Mrs. Bent, rushing forward to lead the way. &quot;There's a furnace of hot
water there, for we've got a wash on to-day. And, Mr. North, sir, you'll just
get <i>yourself</i> between the blankets, if you please, and I'll bring you up a
dose of hot brandy-and-water.&quot;</p>
<p>To see them all scampering over to the Dolphin, with the picked-up coat and
hat, the wind taking their petticoats behind, the two wet figures in their
midst, and Mrs. Castlemaine wringing her hands in despair, was a sight for
Greylands. But, at least, George North had saved the child.</p>
<p>The next event that happened to excite the village was the disappearance of
Jane Hallet from the Nunnery. She disappeared, so to speak. In fact she ran away
from it.</p>
<p>Something like a fortnight had elapsed since her illness, or from that to
three weeks, and she was able to walk about her room and do, at her own request,
some sewing for the Sisters. Mr. Harry Castlemaine had not intruded on the
Nunnery again. It was getting time to think of what was to be done with her:
where she was to go, how she was to live. Jane had been so meek, so humble
throughout this illness, so thankful for the care and kindness shown her, <i>and
for the non-reproach</i>, that the Grey Ladies, in spite of their inward
condemnation, could not help liking her in their hearts almost as much as they
had liked her before, and they felt an anxious interest in her future. Sister
Mildred especially, more reflective than the others by reason of her years,
often wondered what that future was to be, what it could be. Miss Hallet--shut
up in her home, her cheeks pink with shame whenever she had to go abroad: which
she took care should be on Sundays only; but divine service, such as it was in
Greylands, she would not miss--had never been to the Nunnery to see Jane, or
taken the slightest notice of her. Sister Mildred had paid another visit to the
cliff, and held a second conference with Miss Hallet, but it resulted in no good
for Jane.</p>
<p>&quot;She has blighted her own life and embittered mine,&quot; said Miss Hallet. &quot;Never
more can I hold up my head among my neighbours. I will not willingly see her
again; I hope I never shall see her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The worst of it is, that all this reprobation will not undo the past,&quot;
returned Sister Mildred. &quot;If it would, if it could have served to prevent it,
I'd say punish Jane to the last extreme of harshness. But it won't.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She deserves to be punished always.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The evil has come upon her, and everybody knows it. Your receiving her again
in your home will not add to it or take from it. She has nowhere else to go.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I pray you cease, Sister Mildred,&quot; said Miss Hallet; and it was plain to be
seen that she spoke with utter pain. &quot;You cannot--pardon me--you cannot
understand my feelings in this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What shall you do without Jane? She was very useful to you; she was a
companion.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Could I ever make a companion of her again? For the rest, I have taken a
little servant--Brown the blacksmith's eldest girl--and I find her handy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If I could but induce you to be lenient, for Jane's sake!&quot; urged the
pleading Sister, desperately at issue between her own respect for Miss Hallet's
outraged feelings and her compassion for Jane.</p>
<p>&quot;I never can be,&quot; was the answer, spoken stiffly: but Miss Hallet's fingers
were trembling as she smoothed back her black silk mitten. &quot;As to receiving her
under my roof again, why, if I were ever brought to do that, I should be
regarded as no better than herself. I should be no better--as I look upon it.
Madam, you think it right to ask me this, I know: but to entertain it is an
impossibility.&quot;</p>
<p>Sister Mildred dropped her ear-trumpet with a click. The hardness vexed her.
And yet she could but acknowledge that it was in a degree excusable. But for the
difficulties lying in Jane's path, she had never urged it.</p>
<p>So there the matter rested. Miss Hallet had despatched her new servant to the
Nunnery with a portion of Jane's wardrobe: and what on earth was to become of
Jane the Sisters were unable to conjecture. They could not keep her: the Nunnery
was not a reformatory, or meant to be one. Consulting together, they at last
thought of a plan.</p>
<p>Sister Mildred went one morning into Jane's room. Jane was seated at the
window in a shawl, busy at her work--some pinafores for the poor little
school-children. Her face was prettier than ever and very delicate, her manner
deprecating, as she rose and courtesied to the late Superior.</p>
<p>&quot;How are you getting on, Jane?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have nearly finished this one, madam,&quot; she answered, holding out the
pinafore.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't mean as to work. I mean yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I feel nearly quite well now, thank you, madam,&quot; replied Jane. &quot;I get
stronger every day.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was talking about you with some of the ladies last night, Jane. We wonder
what you are about to do. Have you any plan, or idea of your own?&quot;</p>
<p>Poor Jane's face took a shade of crimson. She did not answer.</p>
<p>&quot;Not that we wish to hurry you away from us, Jane. You are welcome to stay,
and we intend you to do so, for at least two weeks yet. Only it will not do to
leave considerations off to the last: this is why I speak to you in time.&quot;</p>
<p>Sister Mildred had sat down close by Jane; by bending her ear, she could do
without the trumpet. Jane's hands, slender always, and weak yet, shook as she
held the pinafore.</p>
<p>&quot;Have you formed any plans, Jane?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh no, ma'am.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I thought so,&quot; returned Sister Mildred, for indeed she did not see what
plans Jane, so lonely and friendless, could form. &quot;When we cannot do what we
would, we must do what we can--that used to be one of your copies in small-hand,
I remember, Jane.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, ma'am.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, my dear, I don't want to speak harshly, but I think you must apply it
to yourself. You can no longer do what you would: you will have to do what you
can. I am sorry to say that your aunt continues inexorable: she will not shelter
you again.&quot;</p>
<p>Jane turned to the table for her handkerchief. The tears were trickling down
her face.</p>
<p>&quot;We--the Sisters and myself--think it will be the best for you to take an
easy place as servant----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As servant!&quot; echoed Jane, looking startled.</p>
<p>&quot;As servant for light work in a good family far away from here. Sister
Margaret thinks she can manage this--her connections are very good, you know. Of
course the truth must be told to them; but you will be taken care of, and made
happy--we would not else place you--and have the opportunity afforded you of
redeeming the past, so far as it may be redeemed. You don't like this, I'm
afraid, Jane; but what else is there that's open to you?&quot;</p>
<p>Jane was sobbing bitterly. She suddenly stooped and kissed the Sister's hand;
but she made no answer.</p>
<p>&quot;I will talk with you again to-morrow,&quot; said Sister Mildred, rising. &quot;Think
it over, Jane--and don't sob like that, child. If you can suggest anything
better, why we'll listen to it. We only want to help you, and to keep you out of
harm for the future.&quot;</p>
<p>Jane was very sad and silent all that day. In the evening, after dark, Sister
Caroline, who had been out on an errand, came in with rounded eyes, declaring
she had seen Jane Hallet out of doors. The ladies reproved her. Sister Caroline
often had fancies.</p>
<p>&quot;If it was not Jane Hallet it was her ghost,&quot; cried Sister Caroline, lightly.
&quot;She was under the cliff by the sea. I never saw anybody so much like Jane in my
life.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Have you been down under the cliff?&quot; questioned Sister Charlotte.</p>
<p>&quot;I went there for a minute or two with poor old Dame Tuff,&quot; explained the
Sister. &quot;She was looking after Jack, who had been missing since morning: she
thought he might be lying under the cliff after too much ale. While we were
peering into all the holes and shady places, somebody ran by exactly like Jane.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ran by where?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Close along, between us and the sea. Towards the Limpets.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But nobody could want anything that way. They might be drowned.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it looked like Jane.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hush!&quot; said one of the graver ladies. &quot;You know it could not be Jane Hallet.
Did you find Jack Tuff?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No: his poor mother's gone home crying. What a trouble sons are! But--may I
go and see if Jane is in her room?&quot;</p>
<p>It was really very obstinate of Sister Caroline: but she was allowed to go.
Down she came with a rush.</p>
<p>Jane was <i>not</i> in her room.</p>
<p>Several of the Sisters, excited by the news, trooped up in a body to see.
Very true. The room had been made neat by Jane, but there was no trace of
herself. On the table lay some lines in pencil addressed to Sister Mildred.</p>
<p>A few lines of grateful, heartfelt thanks for the kindness shown to her, and
an imploring hope that the ladies would think of her with as little harshness as
they could. But not a single word to tell of whither she had gone.</p>
<p>&quot;Pray Heaven she has not done anything rash!&quot; mentally cried Sister Mildred
with pale cheeks, as she thought of the dangers of the path that led to that
part of the coast called the Limpets.</p>

<h4><a name="div1_34" href="#div1Ref_34">CHAPTER XXXIV.</a></h4>
<h5>CHANGED TO PARADISE.</h5>
<br>

<p>The winter season was coming in, but not yet winter weather, for it was mild
and balmy: more like a fine September than the close of November.</p>
<p>The glass doors of the red parlour at Greylands' Rest were thrown open to the
garden, and to the very few autumn flowers that yet lingered around the window.
Dinner was over, and the ladies were back in the parlour again. Little Marie
Guise was spending the day there, and was now playing at cat's-cradle with
Flora: her mother was talking with Mrs. Castlemaine. Ethel sat drawing.</p>
<p>&quot;Dear me! I think this is Miss Castlemaine.&quot;</p>
<p>The words were Madame's, and they all looked up. Yes; advancing round from
the wide garden-path in her grey dress and with her stately step, came Mary
Ursula. Seeing them sitting there, and the doors open, she had turned aside on
her way to the front entrance. Ethel ran out.</p>
<p>&quot;How good of you, Mary! Have you come to stay the afternoon?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, Ethel, dear. I want to see my uncle. Is he at home?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think so. We left him at table. Come in.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Castlemaine made much of the visitor. Disliking Mary Ursula at heart,
thankful that she had joined the Grey Sisterhood for good and was out of the way
of Greylands' Rest, Mrs. Castlemaine made a great show of welcome at these
chance visits.</p>
<p>&quot;And why can you not stay now you are here?&quot; asked Mrs. Castlemaine, purring
upon Mary as she sat down. &quot;Do take your bonnet off.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I would stay if I could,&quot; said Mary, &quot;but I must be back again by four
o'clock. Mr. Knivett sent me a note this morning to say he should be over at
that hour with some papers that require my signature.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then, Mary, why did you not come some afternoon when you were not expecting
Mr. Knivett?&quot; sensibly asked Ethel.</p>
<p>&quot;Because I had to come to-day, Ethel. I wish to see my uncle.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I suppose you have been busy with your money and your executorship,&quot; spoke
Mrs. Castlemaine. &quot;You must feel quite rich.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I do,&quot; said Mary, with earnest truth. Looking back, she had not thought
herself so rich in her anticipated many, many thousands a year then, as she felt
now with these two or three bequeathed hundreds of additional income. &quot;We are
rich or poor by comparison, you know,&quot; she said, smiling. &quot;And what is Marie
doing?--learning to play at cat's cradle?&quot;</p>
<p>Marie snatched the thread from Flora, and ran up to her: she could speak a
little English now.</p>
<p>&quot;Lady play wi' Marie!</p>
<p>&quot;Why, my dear little child, I think I have forgotten how to play,&quot; returned
Mary. &quot;Flora can play better than I can. Flora is none the worse for that
accident, I hope?&quot; she added to Mrs. Castlemaine. &quot;But how serious it might have
been!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, don't, don't talk of it,&quot; cried Mrs. Castlemaine, putting her hands
before her eyes to shut out the mental vision. &quot;I shall never see a furious sea
again without shuddering.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is beautifully calm to-day,&quot; said Mary, rising to go into the dining-room
to her uncle. &quot;Like a mill-pond.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Castlemaine was no longer in the dining-room. Miles putting the wine and
dessert away, said his master had gone up to his room to write letters. So Mary
went after him.</p>
<p>Several days had passed now since the departure of Jane Hallet from the
Nunnery. And the longer the time elapsed without news of her, the greater grew
the marvel of Greylands. The neighbours asked one another whether Jane had
mysteriously disappeared for good, after the fashion of Anthony Castlemaine. It
was rumoured that the affair altogether, connected with Jane, had much annoyed
the Master of Greylands. He was supposed to have talked sharply to his son on
the subject; but how Harry received it, or what he replied, was not known. Harry
rather shunned home just then, and made pretext for excursions to distant
places, which kept him out for a day or two at a time.</p>
<p>But a worse doubt than any was gaining ground: the same doubt that had
crossed Sister Mildred the night of the disappearance. Had Jane committed any
rash act? In short, to speak out boldly, for it is what Greylands did, people
thought that Jane must have flung herself into the sea. The way to the Limpet
rocks--once old Dame Dance's cottage was passed--led to nowhere but the rocks:
and nobody in their senses would seek them at night if they wanted to come away
alive. Clearly there was but one inference to be drawn: Jane was under the
water.</p>
<p>Of course, it was entirely inconsistent with Greylands' neighbourly
outspokenness that this dismal conviction should long be concealed from Miss
Hallet. Perhaps it was considered a matter of conscience to make it known to
her. Mrs. Pike at the shop was the first to run up, and undertake the
communication.</p>
<p>Miss Hallet received it in cold silence: for all the world as if she had been
a stock or a stone, as Mrs. Pike related afterwards: and for a day or two she
held on in her course of high-mightiness. But it could not last. She had human
feelings, as well as other people: it might have been that they were all the
keener from her outward shell of impassive coldness; and they made themselves
heard in spite of her injured pride. The news shocked her; the more she tried to
drive it from her mind, the more persistently it came back to take up its abode
there: and at length a whole flood-tide of remorse and repentance set in: for
she asked herself whether she--<i>she</i>--had helped to drive Jane to her
dreadful fate. It is one thing to browbeat our friends to within an inch of
their lives: but quite another thing to shut them into their coffins.</p>
<p>On the second evening, when twilight was sufficiently dim to enfold her
within its shade, Miss Hallet went down to seek an interview with Sister Mildred
at the Nunnery; and was admitted to her. Mary Ursula Castlemaine was also in the
room, writing at a table apart: but she did not interfere in any way, or take
part in the conversation.</p>
<p>&quot;I have come to know the truth of this,&quot; gasped Miss Hallet, whose every
effort to suppress her agitation and to appear cold as usual, served to impede
her breath. &quot;At least, madam, so far as you can tell it me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But, my dear, good woman, I can't tell you anything,&quot; briskly returned
Sister Mildred, speaking with her trumpet to her ear. &quot;We don't know what to
think ourselves. I wish we did.&quot;</p>
<p>They were sitting side by side on the well-worn horsehair sofa, which was
drawn close to the fire. Mary was in the further corner behind them, a shade on
the candle by which she wrote. Miss Hallet untied the strings of her bonnet, as
if in need of air.</p>
<p>&quot;Jane <i>cannot</i> have put an end to her life!&quot; spoke Miss Hallet, her
trembling lips betokening that she felt less assured of the fact than the words
implied. &quot;She was too religious a girl for anything so desperately wicked; too
well-principled.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That is what I tell myself ten times a day,&quot; returned Sister Mildred. &quot;Or
try to.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Try to!&quot; echoed Miss Hallet.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, you see--you see--&quot; Sister Mildred spoke with hesitation, between
wishing to tell just the truth and dislike to say what must inflict pain--&quot;you
see, the thought that keeps intruding on me is this: having been deceived in my
estimation of Jane's good principles on one point, one is obliged to feel less
sure of them on another.&quot;</p>
<p>A groan broke from Miss Hallet; she coughed to cover it. But in another
moment her misery got the better of her, and all reticence was thrown away.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, if you can help me to find her--if you can give me a hope that she is
still living, do so, dear lady, for heaven's sake,&quot; she implored, placing her
hands, in her irrepressible agitation, on the arm of Sister Mildred. &quot;Let me not
have her death upon my conscience!&quot;</p>
<p>The good Sister took both the hands and held them in hers. &quot;For my own sake,
I would do it if I could,&quot; she gently said. &quot;To find Jane, I would forfeit a
good deal that is precious to me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is killing me,&quot; said Miss Hallet. &quot;It will kill me speedily unless this
incertitude can be ended. For the past two days, I have not had one moment's
peace. Night and day, night and day, the one dreadful doubt is upon me with a
harrowing torment. Where is Jane?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot think where she can be,&quot; said Sister Mildred, shaking her head.
&quot;Nobody seems to know.&quot;</p>
<p>A moment's silence, and then the sound of hysterics burst upon the room:
cries, and sobs, and catchings of the breath. Miss Hallet had not given way like
this even when her nephew died.</p>
<p>But, alas, they could give her no satisfaction, no comfort. Sister Mildred,
shaking hands with her before departure, spoke cheerfully of hope, of &quot;looking
on the bright side of things,&quot; but it was very negative consolation.</p>
<p>&quot;My dear, did you take note of what passed?&quot; questioned Sister Mildred of
Mary Ursula, when they were alone. &quot;How distressing this is!&quot;</p>
<p>Mary rose from her desk and came forward. &quot;My heart was aching for her all
the time,&quot; she said. &quot;Miss Hallet may have acted somewhat harshly; but she has
my greatest pity. I wish I could relieve her!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If anyone in this world knows where Jane is, it must be Mr. Harry
Castlemaine,&quot; observed Sister Mildred in a cold, subdued whisper. &quot;That is, if
she be still alive. I wonder, my dear, whether we might ask him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Whether he would give any information, you mean,&quot; replied Mary Ursula. &quot;He
ought to; and I think he would. Though, perhaps, it might be better got at
through his father.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Through his father!&quot; echoed Sister Mildred, quickly. &quot;Oh, my dear, we should
never dare to question the Master of Greylands.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I would: and will,&quot; concluded Mary Ursula.</p>
<p>It was in pursuance of this resolve that Mary had come up this afternoon to
Greylands' Rest. Harry had gone to Newerton for a day or two, this time really
upon business. Mary went upstairs and knocked at her uncle's door.</p>
<p>The Master of Greylands was doing nothing. He had apparently been writing at
his bureau, for the flap was down, one drawer stood out and some papers were
lying open. He had quitted it, and sat back in a chair near the window; his eyes
resting on the calm sea stretched out in the distance. Which sea, however, he
never saw; his thoughts were far away.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing has gone right since that fatal night,&quot; he said to himself, his brow
knitted into lines of pain. &quot;Teague has said all the summer that suspicions are
abroad--though I think he must be wrong; and now there's this miserable trouble
about Harry and that girl! For myself, I seem to be treading on a volcano. The
stir after Anthony is not at an end yet: I am sure of it; instinct warns me that
it is not: and should a comprehensive search be instituted, who can tell where
it would end, or what might come to light?&quot;</p>
<p>A log of blazing wood fell on the hearth with a splutter and crash. Mr.
Castlemaine looked round mechanically: but all was safe. The room was just as
lonely and bare as usual: no signs of life or occupation in it, save the master
himself and the papers in the open bureau.</p>
<p>&quot;When men look askance at me,&quot; ran on his thoughts, &quot;it makes my blood boil.
I am living it down; I shall live it down; but I have not dared to openly resent
it and that has told against me. And if the stir should arise again, and
unpleasant facts come out--why then it would be all over with the good name of
the Master of Greylands. The world calls me proud: and I am proud. Heaven knows,
though, that I have had enough this year to take pride out of me.&quot;</p>
<p>A deep sigh, telling of the inward trouble, escaped him. Men whose minds are
at ease cannot sigh like that.</p>
<p>&quot;It has been an unlucky year for the Castlemaines: a fatal year. After a long
tide of prosperity such years do come, I suppose, to a family. Peter's trouble
first, and his uncertain death:--and what a near shave it was, the staving off
disgrace from his name! Anthony's intrusion and the trouble he gave me, and then
<i>his</i> death: that, unfortunately, had nothing uncertain about it. The cloud
that fell upon me, and that lasts still; and now, Teague's doubts; and now
again, Harry! Better for me, perhaps, to get out of it all, while the
opportunity remains.&quot;</p>
<p>A heavy sigh broke from him, coming apparently from the very depth of his
heart. He put his elbow on the arm of his chair, and leaned his brow upon his
hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Poor Anthony,&quot; he moaned, after a pause. &quot;Oh, if the doings of that night
could but be recalled! I would give the best years of my remaining life to undo
its fatal work. Just one moment of mad, impetuous passion, and it was all over!
What can his friends be about, I wonder, that they have not come to see after
him? I thought he said he had a brother, at that first interview; but I have
never been sure, for I was feeling resentful, half checkmated, and I would not
listen to him. I am certain he said he had a sister--married, I think, to a
Frenchman. They have not come; they do not write: French people don't care for
their relatives, perhaps--and they must be French rather than English. If
Anthony----&quot;</p>
<p>A gentle knock at the door had been unheard by Mr. Castlemaine: a second
knock was followed by the entrance of Mary Ursula in her Sister's dress. So
entirely was Mr. Castlemaine buried in these unpleasant, far away scenes, that
just for a moment he stared at the intruder, his mind completely absent. Mary
could not help noticing his haggard look and the pain that sat in his eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, Mary Ursula, is it you?&quot; he cried, starting up. &quot;Come in, my dear.&quot;</p>
<p>With a rapid movement, as he advanced to meet her, he swept the papers back
and closed the bureau. Taking her hands in his he kissed her, and put a chair
for her near the fire. But Mary would not sit down. She had not time, she said:
and she went and stood by the window.</p>
<p>It was not a pleasant matter for her to enter upon, and she spoke very
slightly and briefly. Just saying that if he, her uncle, had learnt anything
through his son of Jane Hallet, it would be a relief to the Grey Ladies if he
would impart it, and especially to the aunt, who was in a distressing state of
suspense; fears, that Jane had made away with herself, existing in Greylands.</p>
<p>&quot;My dear, I know nothing whatever of her,&quot; said Mr. Castlemaine, standing at
the window by the side of his niece. &quot;The whole of the affair has been most
grievous to me, most annoying--as you may well conceive. I had some words with
Harry at the time; sharp ones; and it has created a sort of coolness between us.
Since then, we have mutually avoided the subject.&quot;</p>
<p>Mary sighed. &quot;I cannot help being sorry for Jane,&quot; she said, &quot;whatever may be
the end. She is too good to have lost herself. You do not know, Uncle James, how
nice she is.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;'Sorry' is not the word for it,&quot; emphatically spoke the Master of Greylands,
his stern tone meant for his absent son. &quot;I always held the Hallets in respect.&quot;</p>
<p>Mary turned from the window to depart. Other things were perplexing her as
well as this unfortunate business. It struck her more and more how ill her uncle
looked; ill, and full of care. Lines had begun to indent themselves on his once
smooth brow.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you well, Uncle James?&quot; she stayed to say.</p>
<p>&quot;Why do you ask?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You do not look well. There is something in your face now that--that----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That what, child?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That reminds me of papa. As he looked the last month or two of his life.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ay. I have had some worry lately, from more sources than one. And that tries
a man's looks, Mary, worse than all.&quot;</p>
<p>He attended her downstairs. She said farewell to the red parlour, and
commenced her walk back to the Nunnery.</p>
<p>Somewhat later, before the dusk of the November evening came on, Madame Guise
attired herself to take home Marie. The little girl was showing symptoms of a
delicate chest, and the Sisters had begged her mother to let her be in betimes.
To please the child they went on through the back buildings, which were at some
distance from the house, that she might see the ducks, and cocks and hens.</p>
<p>Quitting the fold-yard to cross the meadow, which would bring them round to
the avenue, they came upon Mr. North. He sat on the stump of a tree, sketching a
bit of the old barn.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you here, George!&quot; spoke Madame. &quot;What are you doing?&quot;</p>
<p>He held out the sketch to show her: pulling little Marie to him at the same
time, to give her a kiss.</p>
<p>&quot;Why you not come to see me?&quot; asked the child in French. For she had taken a
great fancy to this pleasant gentleman, who sometimes had bonbons in his pocket
for her, calling him, at the Nunnery, little incipient coquette, le joli
monsieur.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, I think I must come and see Miss Marie one of these fine days. Does
Marie like dolls?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I like four, five dolls,&quot; said Marie.</p>
<p>&quot;Four, five!&quot; laughed George. &quot;Why it would be an army. We shall have to
dismantle a shop.</p>
<p>&quot;I must be going, Marie,&quot; said her mother. &quot;And you will have to make haste
with that drawing, George. You will not see very much longer.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I shall finish it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Have you heard anything, George--gathered anything--that can throw light on
poor Anthony?&quot; she looked back, to ask in a whisper.</p>
<p>&quot;Never a word,&quot; he answered.</p>
<p>&quot;Nor I. I begin almost to despair. Au revoir.&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, indoors, Mr. Castlemaine had gone up to his room again, and Flora
in the red parlour was making herself disagreeable as usual. The young lady's
insistence that Marie should stay to tea had met with no response, and she was
sulky in consequence.</p>
<p>For some little time she relieved herself by kicking her feet about, throwing
down the fire-irons, and giving shakes to the table to disturb Ethel. By-and-by,
when it grew dusk, and Mrs. Castlemaine had to hold her book very close to her
eyes and Ethel to put up her drawing, the young lady saw a larger field for
annoyance. Advancing to the piano, she brought both her hands down on the keys
with her whole might. The result was a crash that might have aroused the seven
sleepers.</p>
<p>&quot;How dare you, Flora?&quot; exclaimed Ethel. &quot;Don't you know the piano was tuned
this week?&quot;</p>
<p>A derisive laugh: and another crash.</p>
<p>&quot;Mamma, will you speak to her?&quot;</p>
<p>Crash the third. Mrs. Castlemaine, absorbed by her book of romance, took no
notice whatever.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you think I will have my piano served in that way and the wires broken?&quot;
cried Ethel, starting up. &quot;What a dreadful child you are!&quot;</p>
<p>A tussle--for the young lass was strong, and was leaning with her whole
weight and her two arms on the keys--and then Ethel succeeded in shutting and
locking it. It was Ethel's own piano: a present to her from Mr. Castlemaine, and
a beautiful instrument. Mademoiselle la mchante turned to the table, took up
Ethel's drawing-book and began rumpling the leaves.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, mamma, mamma, why do you not speak to her?&quot; cried Ethel, in distress, as
she tried to get possession of the book, and failed. &quot;Mamma!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How tiresome you are, Ethel!&quot; exclaimed Mrs. Castlemaine explosively: for
her story was at a most interesting part, and she could not be disturbed during
these last few moments of daylight. &quot;Sit down and be quiet. The dear child would
do no harm, if you only let her alone.&quot;</p>
<p>The dear child had retreated to the open part of the room beyond the table,
and was dancing there like a little maniac, flirting over the leaves at Ethel in
derision. These petty annoyances are hard to bear. Injustice is hard to bear,
even where the temper is naturally as sweet as Ethel's.</p>
<p>&quot;Give me that book,&quot; said Ethel, going up to Flora.</p>
<p>&quot;I shan't.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I tell you, Flora, to give it to me.&quot;</p>
<p>Flora was holding the book open above her head, a cover stretched in each
hand, and laughing an ugly, mocking laugh. Suddenly, without warning, she dashed
it full in Ethel's face: a pretty sharp blow.</p>
<p>Smarting, angry, Ethel seized the tiresome child by the arms. Flora shrieked,
and called out in a rage that Ethel was pinching her. Very likely it might be
so, for the grasp was a tight one. Flora dropped the book, and struck Ethel in
the face with all the force of her wrathful hand. Her pale face tingling with
the smart, agitated, indignant, but the book secured, Ethel stood before Mrs.
Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;Am I to bear this, mamma?--and you look on and say nothing!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You should let her alone: it is your own fault,&quot; contemptuously retorted
Mrs. Castlemaine.</p>
<p>Justice in that house for her!--unless Mr. Castlemaine was at hand!--Ethel
had long ceased to hope for it. But the present moment was unusually bitter; it
tried her terribly. She quitted the room; and, seeing the hall-door open, ran
out in a storm of tears and sobs, and dashed along the path.</p>
<p>It was dusk but not dark; the bared trees, the wintry shrubs, the cold beds
telling of the departed flowers, all spoke of loneliness. But not more lonely,
they, than Ethel.</p>
<p>She stood when she came to the outer gate and flung her arms upon it, sobbing
bitterly; gazing down the avenue, as if longing to go forth into the world for
ever. Alas, there was no chance of that; she was tied to this home, so
oftentimes made miserable. Had Ethel been poor she might have gone out as
governess: but that plea could not be raised.</p>
<p>Bending her face upon her hands, which rested still upon the gate, she gave
way to all the minute's gloomy anguish, weeping aloud. Not a living being was in
sight or hearing; she believed herself as much alone as though it had been some
unpeopled desert and could indulge her passionate grief at will.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh Ethel, what is this?&quot;</p>
<p>It was a soft, low, pained voice that spoke the words in her ear; a fond hand
was laid upon her head; the only voice, the only hand that could have thrilled
her heart.</p>
<p>Mr. North, passing into the avenue on his way home from sketching the piece
of the old barn, his portfolio being under his arm, had come upon her thus.
Opening the gate, he drew her on to the bench under the high laurel trees and
sat down by her.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, tell me what it is?&quot;</p>
<p>Beguiled by the seduction of the moment, smarting still under the treatment
she had received, contrasting his loving, gentle kindness with the cruel
indifference of the only mother she had ever known, Ethel sobbed out a brief
account of what had passed. His breast heaved with angry passion.</p>
<p>&quot;Is it often so, Ethel?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yes, very. It has been so for years. I have never had any one to really
love me since my father died; I have never known what it is to have a securely
happy home: only this one of frequent turbulence. I wish I could run away from
it!&quot;</p>
<p>He was no more prudent than she. He forgot wisdom, circumstances, reason:
all. His breath short, his words unchosen, he poured forth the tale of his love,
and asked her if she would be his wife. Ethel bent her face on his coat-sleeve,
and cried silent, happy tears.</p>
<p>&quot;You know, you must know, how I have loved you, Ethel. I should have spoken
long ago, but that circumstances held me back. Even now I fear that I cannot
speak openly to Mr. Castlemaine: it may be some little time first. But oh, my
darling, you have not, you cannot have mistaken my love.&quot;</p>
<p>Not a word. It was early yet for confession from her. But her face was still
on his arm.</p>
<p>&quot;For one thing, I am not rich, Ethel. I have quite enough for comfort, but
not that which would give you a home like this. And Mr. Castlemaine----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I would rather be in a cottage with bread, than here,&quot; she interrupted, all
her candour rising to the surface.</p>
<p>&quot;And Mr. Castlemaine may not choose that you shall pit this house for one
less well set-up, I was about to say, my love,&quot; he went on. &quot;What we might find
sufficient competence, he might deem poverty.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have plenty of money of my own,&quot; said Ethel simply.</p>
<p>&quot;Have you?&quot; cried Mr. North, in a surprised and anything but a gratified
tone. He had certainly never known or suspected that she had money; and he
foresaw that the fact might be only an additional reason for Mr. Castlemaine's
rejection of him. &quot;It may be so much the worse for us, Ethel. I may come into
money myself; quite sufficient to satisfy even Mr. Castlemaine; or I may not. It
is this uncertainty that has helped to keep me silent. But come what will now,
we cannot part.&quot;</p>
<p>No, they could never part. Heart beating against heart, knew and ratified it.
He gathered her face to his, whispering his sweet love-vows as he kissed off its
tears.</p>
<p>And, for Ethel, the lonely surroundings, the dreary paths, the bare beds, the
wintry trees, seemed suddenly to have changed into the Garden of Paradise.</p>
<br>

<h4><a name="div1_35" href="#div1Ref_35">CHAPTER XXXV.</a></h4>
<h5>THE LAST CARGO.</h5>
<br>

<p>At the window of her bedroom in the Grey Nunnery, steadily gazing out to sea,
stood Mary Ursula Castlemaine. The night was almost as light as though the moon
were shining: for a sort of light haze, partially covering the skies, seemed to
illumine the earth and make things visible.</p>
<p>December had come in, but the weather was still balmy: people said to one
another that they were going to have no winter. It had been one of those
exceptional years when England seems to have borrowed some more genial climate:
since the changeable spring there had been only smiles and sunshine.</p>
<p>As the days and weeks had gone on since that communication made to Miss
Castlemaine by Walter Dance the night of his accident (to be retracted by him in
the morning), the doubt in her mind and the uneasiness it caused rarely gave her
rest. She had not dared to speak of it to Mr. Castlemaine: had she been
perfectly sure that he was in ignorance in regard to it--in short, to speak out
plainly, that he was not implicated, she would have told him all; but the
uncertainty withheld her. The evidence of her own senses she could not question,
therefore she did believe, that the wholesale smuggling, confessed to by young
Dance in his fear of death, was an actual fact--that cargoes of lace, and what
not, were periodically run. The question agitating her was--had, or had not,
this treason the complicity of the Master of Greylands? If it had, she must be
silent on the subject for ever; if it had not, why then she would like to
communicate with himself upon it. For an idea had taken firm hold of her,
arising she knew not from what instinct, that the ill-fate of Anthony--had any
ill-fate in truth overtaken him--must have arisen through the doings of one of
these disturbed nights when the Friar's Keep was invaded by lawless bands of
sailors.</p>
<p>It was for this reason she could not rest; it was this never-forgotten
thought that disturbed her peace by day and her sleep by night. The smuggling
and the smugglers she would only have been too glad to forget; but the
mysterious fate of Anthony lay on her mind like a chronic nightmare. Another
thing, too, added to her disquietude. The Grey Monk, about which nothing had
been heard for some weeks past, was now, according to public rumour, appearing
again.</p>
<p>In her heart she suspected that this Grey Monk and all the rest of the
mystery had to do with the smuggling and with that only. Reason told her, or
strove to tell her, that Commodore Teague was the principal in it all, the
cunning man, for whom the goods were run; and she tried to put down that latent
doubt of Mr. Castlemaine that would rise up unbidden. If she could but set that
little doubt at rest! she was ever saying to herself. If she could but once
ascertain that her uncle had nothing to do with the unlawful practices, why then
she would disclose to him what she knew, and leave him to search out this clue
to the disappearance of Anthony.</p>
<p>Many a night had she stood at her casement window as she was standing now;
though not always, perhaps oftener than not. But not until to-night had she seen
the same two-masted vessel--or what she took to be the same. It had certainly
not been visible at sunset: but there it lay now, its masts tapering upwards,
and its shape distinctly visible in the white haze, just in the same spot that
it had been that other night.</p>
<p>Mary wrapped herself up, and put her casement window open, and sat down and
watched. Watched and waited. As the clocks told midnight, some stir was
discernible on board; and presently the small boats, as before, came shooting
out from the ship through the water. There could be no mistake: another of those
nefarious cargoes was about to be run.</p>
<p>With a pale face but resolute heart, Mary Ursula Castlemaine rose up. She
would go forth again through the secret passage, and look on at these men. Not
to denounce them; not to betray her presence or her knowledge of what they were
about; but simply to endeavour to ascertain whether her uncle made one at the
work.</p>
<p>Procuring the keys and the dark lantern, Mary started. There was some delay
at setting out, in consequence of her being unable to open the first door. Try
with all her force, though she would and did, she could not turn the key in the
lock. And she was on the point of giving it up as hopeless, when the key
yielded. At least a quarter of an hour must have been hindered over this.</p>
<p>It was colder by far in the passage than it had been those other nights, for
the time of the year was later: cold, and damp, and wofully dreary. Mary's
courage oozed out at every step. Once she paused, questioning whether she could
go on with this, but she reasoned herself into it. She reached the other end,
set her light on the floor, and put the key into this second door.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the boats had come in, been hauled up on the beach, and the goods
were being landed. The men worked with a will. They wore sea-boots and waded
through the water with the bales on their shoulders. Much jabbering was carried
on, for some of the sailors were foreigners; but all spoke in covert tones. No
one could be near enough to hear them, by land or by sea; they felt well assured
of that; but it was always best to be prudent. The sailors were working as they
worked on board ship, open and undisguised; Commodore Teague was undisguised;
but the other three men--for there were three others--wore capes and had huge
caps tied on over their ears and brows; and in the uncertain light their best
friends might not have known them. Two of these, it is as well to say it, were
Tom Dance and his son; the other was a tall, slender, fine-figured young man,
who seemed to look on, rather than to work, and who had not the heavy sea-boots
on. But there was no sign of the Master of Greylands. The bales were carried up
and put down in the dry, close to the walls of the Keep. When all the goods that
were to come out of the ship should be landed, then the sailors would help to
carry them through the passage to the cellars of the Hutt, before finally
returning on board.</p>
<p>&quot;Where you lay de pistols?&quot; asked a sailor in imperfect English, as he slung
down a huge bale from his shoulder.</p>
<p>&quot;Down there as usual, Jansen,&quot; replied another, pointing to some raised
stone-work projecting from the walls of the Keep. &quot;And the cutlasses too. Where
should they be!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do Jansen ask that for, Bill?&quot; questioned one, of the last speaker.</p>
<p>&quot;I get a bad dream last night,&quot; said Jansen, answering for himself. &quot;I dream
we all fighting, head, tail, wi' dem skulking coastguard. 'Jack,' he says to me
in dream, 'where de knives, where de pistols?'--and we search about and we not
find no knives, no pistols, and dey overpower us, and I call out, an' den I
wake.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't like them dreams,&quot; cried one of the ship's crew. &quot;Dreams be hanged;
there's nothing in 'em,&quot; struck in Tom Dance. &quot;I dreamed one night, years ago,
as my old mother was lying dead afore me: stead o' that, she told me next day
she'd get married again if I didn't behave myself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bear a hand here, Dance,&quot; said the Commodore.</p>
<p>At this moment, there was heard the sounds of a boat, clashing up through the
waters.</p>
<p>Before the men could well look out, or discover what it meant, she was close
in, and upon them. A boat that had stolen silently out from under the walls of
the Grey Nunnery, where she had been lying concealed, waiting to pounce upon her
prey. It was a boat belonging to the preventive service, and it contained Mr.
Superintendent Nettleby and his coastguardsmen. After years of immunity the
smugglers were discovered at last.</p>
<p>&quot;In the King's name!&quot; shouted the superintendent, as he sprung into the
shallow water.</p>
<p>M. Jansen's dream had not told him true; inasmuch as the pistols and
cutlasses lay ready to hand, and were at once snatched up by their owners. A
desperate fight ensued; a hand-to-hand struggle: pistols were fired, oaths were
hissed out, knives were put to work. But though the struggle was fierce it was
very short: all the efforts of the smugglers, both sailors and landsmen, were
directed to securing their own safety by escaping to the ship. And just as Mary
Ursula appeared upon the scene, they succeeded in pushing the boats off, and
scrambling into them.</p>
<p>Mary was horror-struck. She had bargained for seeing rough men running
packages of goods; but she had never thought of fighting and cries and murder.
Once within the vaults of the Friar's Keep the noise had guided her to the open
door she had seen before, open again now; and she stood there sick and
trembling.</p>
<p>They did not see her; she took care of that: hiding behind a pillar, her
lantern darkened, she peeped out, shivering, on the scene. In the confusion she
understood very little; she saw very little; though the cause of it all was
plain enough to her mind--the smugglers had been surprised by the preventive
men. In the preventive-service boat lay a bound and wounded sailor-prisoner, and
also one of the customs' men who had been shot through the leg: not to speak of
minor wounds and contusions on both sides. Of all that, however, Mary knew
nothing until later. There she stood close to the scene of turmoil, hearing the
harsh voices, the rough words, glancing out at the pile of goods, and at the
dusky figures before her, moving about in the night. It was like a panoramic
picture dimly seen.</p>
<p>Almost as by sleight of hand, for Mary did not see how or where they went,
the men and the commotion disappeared together. The ship's boats, unfollowed,
were hastening away to the ship; but what became of Mr. Nettleby and his staff?
A moment ago, the small portion of the beach close before her, that was not
under water, had been alive with the preventive men; Mary had recognised the
superintendent's voice as he shouted out some order, and now not a soul was
visible. No doubt they were exploring the inner corners of this bit of beach,
never suspected of fraud, never visited by his Majesty's servants until now. She
cautiously advanced a step or two and looked out. There lay, hauled up on the
beach halfway, the waiting boat, which she supposed to be unoccupied: the two
wounded men, one of them having fainted from loss of blood, were lying down flat
in it, invisible to her.</p>
<p>A short while, and the officers reappeared. Mary drew back and went behind a
pillar. Some of them got into the boat, and it was pushed off; three of them
remained, either from want of space in the boat, or to keep guard over the
goods; one of them was Mr. Nettleby.</p>
<p>Of what use for Mary to stay? None. She could not solve the doubt touching
her uncle. Oh, that she had never come! she kept thinking to herself; that she
had not had this most dreadful scene portrayed to her! Never again, she felt all
too certain of it, should she attempt to enter the Keep by the subterranean
passage.</p>
<p>Pushing up the slide of one side of the lantern to guide her steps, she was
retracing her way through the vaults, when a ray of the light flashed upon a
figure. A moving figure in woman's clothes, that seemed to be endeavouring to
hide itself. Mary lifted her lantern, and saw the face of Jane Hallet.</p>
<p>Of Jane Hallet! Just for a moment or two a sickness as of some supernatural
fear seized upon Miss Castlemaine. For Jane had never been heard of yet in
Greylands, and very little doubt existed that she had found her bed at the
bottom of the sea. The dark hood she was in the habit of wearing at night had
fallen back from her face: her eyes wore a strange, terrified, appealing look in
the sudden and startling light.</p>
<p>Recovering her better reason, Mary laid her detaining hand upon her before
she could escape. Which of the two faces was the whiter, it were hard to say.</p>
<p>&quot;It is you, Jane Hallet!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, madam, it is me,&quot; gasped Jane in answer.</p>
<p>&quot;Where have you been all this while, and whence do you come? And what brings
you in this place now?&quot;</p>
<p>The explanation was given in a few brief sentences. Jane, alarmed at the idea
presented to her by the Grey Ladies of going out to service, against which step
there existed private reasons, had taken straight refuge in Dame Dance's cottage
under the cliff; she had been there ever since and was there still. Old Mrs.
Dance was like a mother to her, she added; and had been in her entire confidence
for a long while. As to what brought her in that place to-night, why--she was
watching,--she told Miss Castlemaine with much emotion--watching for the
dreadful evil that had to-night occurred.</p>
<p>&quot;I have been dreading it always, madam,&quot; she said, her breath short in its
agitation. &quot;I knew, through my brother, of the work that was sometimes done
here--though he betrayed it to me by accident, not intentionally. I have come to
the chapel ruins of a night to see if there were preparations being made for
running a cargo, and to look whether the vessel, whose shape I knew, was
standing out at sea. One night in the autumn I saw them run the goods: I was
watching all the while. It was one o'clock when I got home, and my aunt was fit
to strike me: for I could not tell her why I stayed out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Watching for what?&quot; imperiously spoke Miss Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, madam, don't you see?--for the preventive men. I was ever fearing that
they would discover the work some night, and surprise it--as they have now done.
I thought if I were on the watch for this (which nobody else, so far as I could
guess, seemed to fear or think of) I might be in time to warn--to warn those who
were doing it. But the officers were too cunning for me, too quick: as I stood
just now looking over the low brink in the chapel ruins, I saw a boat shoot past
from underneath the walls of the Nunnery, and I knew what it was. Before I got
down here the fight had begun.&quot;</p>
<p>Jane had gone into a fit of trembling. Somehow Miss Castlemaine's heart was
hardening to her.</p>
<p>&quot;At nine o'clock this evening I thought I saw the vessel standing off in the
far distance,&quot; resumed Jane: &quot;so I came out later and watched her move up to her
usual place, and have been watching since in the chapel ruins.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;May I inquire who knew of this watching of yours?&quot; asked Mary Ursula, her
tone full of resentment.</p>
<p>&quot;Not any one, madam. Not any one in the world.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not Mr. Harry Castlemaine?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, no. I should not dare to speak of the subject to him, unless he first
spoke of it to me. I have wished he would.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As there is nothing more that can be done here to-night, of watching or
else, I think you had better return home, Jane Hallet,&quot; spoke Miss Castlemaine
in the same proud, cold tone: though she inwardly wondered which way of egress
Jane would take.</p>
<p>&quot;I was just going,&quot; spoke the trembling girl. &quot;There--there is not--oh!
forgive me, madam!--any one lying wounded on the beach, I hope?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I presume not,&quot; replied Miss Castlemaine. &quot;The superintendent and his men
are there.&quot;</p>
<p>Jane Hallet turned meekly, and disappeared amid the pillars. Miss Castlemaine
rightly conjectured that there must be some stairs leading from these lower
cloisters to the cloisters above that opened on the chapel ruins. By these Jane
had no doubt descended, and would now ascend. In point of fact, it was so.
George Hallet had eventually made a clean breast of all the secret to Jane,
including the openings and passages. But the underground passage to the Grey
Nunnery neither he nor any one else had known of.</p>
<p>Miss Castlemaine turned to it now. She was crossing towards it, her dim
lantern held aloft to steer her between the pillars, when her foot stumbled
against something. Pacing slowly, she did not fall, and recovered herself at
once. Bringing the light to bear, she stooped down and saw a man lying there on
his back. He looked immensely tall, and wore a big cape, and had a cap muffled
over his forehead and eyes, and lay still as one dead. With another faint
sickness of heart, Mary pulled the cap upwards, for she thought she recognised
the handsome features. Alas, yes! they were those of Harry Castlemaine: and they
were set in what looked like the rigidness of death.</p>
<p>With a shrill cry--for her feelings got the better of her--Mary called him by
name, and shook him gently. No, there was no response: he was surely dead! She
tore the cape and cap off, flinging them aside; she put her hand to his heart,
and could feel no pulse; she lifted one of his hands, and it fell again like a
heavy weight. There could be little doubt that he must have been wounded during
the fight, had run into the vaults, intending to make his escape by the chapel
ruins, and had fallen down exhausted. Panting with fear and emotion, all
considerations lost sight of in this one great shock, Mary went back to the
beach crying for aid, and supremely astonishing Mr. Superintendent Nettleby.</p>
<p>Mr. Harry Castlemaine! Mr. Harry Castlemaine lying inside there as one dead!
Why, how did that come about? What had brought him down there? unless, indeed,
he had heard the row and the fighting? But then--how did he get down?</p>
<p>Mr. Nettleby spoke these problems aloud, as he proceeded by Miss
Castlemaine's side to the spot, guided by her lantern, and followed by his two
men. He assumed that the Grey Nunnery must have been aroused by the noise, and
that the Lady Superior had come forth to see what it meant: and he politely
apologised for having been the cause of disturbance to the Sisters. Mary allowed
him to think this: and made no answer to his further expressed wonder of how <i>
she</i> found her way down.</p>
<p>When they reached the spot where lay Harry Castlemaine, the first object the
rays of the lantern flashed on was Jane Hallet. Aroused by Miss Castlemaine's
cry, she had hastened back again and was now kneeling beside him, her trembling
hands chafing his lifeless ones, her face a distressing picture of mute agony.</p>
<p>&quot;Move away,&quot; spoke Miss Castlemaine.</p>
<p>Jane rose instantly, with a catching of the breath, and obeyed. Mr.
Superintendent Nettleby, asking for the lantern to be held by one of his men,
and to have its full light turned on, knelt down and proceeded to make what
examination he could.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think he is dead, madam,&quot; he said to Mary Ursula, &quot;but I do fear he
is desperately wounded. How the dickens can it have come about?&quot; he added, in a
lower tone, meant for himself, and rising from his knees. &quot;Could one of the
fools have fired off a shot in here, and caught him as he was coming on to us?
Well, we must get him up to land somehow--and my boat's gone off!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He had better be brought to the Grey Nunnery: it is the nearest place,&quot;
spoke Mary.</p>
<p>&quot;True,&quot; said the officer. &quot;But which on earth is the way to it out of here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Up these stairs. I will show you,&quot; said Jane Hallet, stepping forward again.
&quot;Please let me go on with the lantern.&quot;</p>
<p>She caught it up: she seemed nearly beside herself with grief and distress;
and the officer and men raised Harry Castlemaine. Mary remembered the cape she
had thrown aside, and could not see it, or the cap either. It was just as well,
she thought, for the things had looked to her like garments worn for disguise,
and they might have told tales. Even then an idea was crossing her that the
worst--the complicity of the Castlemaines with the smuggling--might be kept from
the world. Yes, it was just as well: that cape and cap might have been
recognised by the superintendent and his men as being the same sort that were
worn by the iniquitous offenders they had surprised. No such sinners in the
whole decalogue of the world's crimes, according to the estimation of Mr.
Nettleby, as those who defrauded his Majesty's revenues.</p>
<p>&quot;He must have come out without his hat, or else lost it,&quot; spoke the
superintendent, looking down at the head he supported. &quot;Take care, my men,
that's--blood.&quot;</p>
<p>The stairs were soon reached: some winding steps cut in stone. Jane Hallet
held the lantern to show the way; Miss Castlemaine, saying never a word of the
secret passage, followed her; the men with their burden bringing up the rear. It
was a difficult job to bring him up, for the staircase was very narrow. They
came out by a concealed door at the end of the upper cloisters, and had to walk
through them to the chapel ruins. Mr. Nettleby never supposed but that the two
women, as well as Harry Castlemaine, had come down by this route.</p>
<p>&quot;To think that I should never have suspected any stairs were there! or that
there was another set of cloisters under these!&quot; he exclaimed in
self-humiliation, as he walked on through with the rest, avoiding the pillars.
&quot;Had I known it, and that there was a door opening to that strip of beach below,
it would have been enough to tell me what might be going on. But how the deuce
do they contrive to get rid of the goods after they are run?&quot;</p>
<p>For Mr. Superintendent Nettleby was still ignorant of on thing--the secret
passage to Commodore Teague's house. He would not be likely to discover or
suspect that until the official search took place that would be made on the
morrow.</p>
<p>Once more the Nunnery was about to be disturbed to admit a wounded man at
midnight: this second man, alas! wounded unto death. Tom Dance's son had gone
forth to the world again, little the worse for his wounds; for the son and heir
of the Master of Greylands, earth was closing.</p>
<p>The clanging night-bell aroused the inmates; and Sister Rachel, who was that
week portress, went down accompanied by Sister Caroline. To describe their
astonishment when they saw the line of those waiting to enter, would be
impossible. Harry Castlemaine, whom the motion and air had revived, borne by Mr.
Nettleby and two of the coastguardsmen; the Superior, Mary Ursula; and the
resuscitated Jane Hallet! Jane the erring, with the Nunnery lantern!</p>
<p>&quot;Business called me abroad to-night: I did not disturb you,&quot; quietly observed
Sister Mary Ursula to the round-eyed Sisters; and it was all the explanation she
gave, then or later.</p>
<p>Harry was taken into the same room that Walter Dance had been, and laid upon
the same flat, wide sofa. One of the men ran off for Mr. Parker. The other went
back with the superintendent to the scene of the struggle. The captured goods,
so many of them as had been landed, had to be zealously guarded: Mr.
Superintendent Nettleby had never gained such a feather in his official cap as
this.</p>
<p>Harry Castlemaine lay where he had been placed, his once fresh face bereft of
its fine colour, his eyes open to the movements around.</p>
<p>A patient like this was altogether different from young Dance the fisherman,
and the Sisters had gone to awaken and amaze the Nunnery with the news. Only
Mary Ursula was with him.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Parker will soon be here, Harry,&quot; she said gently, bending over him.</p>
<p>A faint smile crossed his lips. &quot;He can do nothing for me, Mary.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nay, you must not think that. You feel ill, faint; I know it; but----&quot;</p>
<p>Some slight stir behind her had caught Mary's senses, and caused her to turn.
There was Jane Hallet, standing half in, half out at the door, a mute,
deprecatory appeal for permission to enter, shining unmistakably on her sad
white face.</p>
<p>&quot;Back!&quot; said Mary with calm authority, advancing to the door with her most
stately step, her hand raised to repel the intruder. &quot;I told you to go home,
Jane Hallet: it is the only thing you can do. You have no right to intrude
yourself into the Nunnery. Go.&quot;</p>
<p>And she quietly closed the door, shutting Jane out, and returned to the
bedside.</p>
<p>Harry's hand was feebly stretched out: it fell on her arm. &quot;Let her come in,
Mary: she is my wife.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your wife!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes; my wife. She has been my wife all along.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I do not understand,&quot; faltered Mary Ursula, feeling she hardly knew how.</p>
<p>&quot;We were married at the beginning of last winter. Fear of my father's
displeasure has prevented my declaring it.&quot;</p>
<p>Mary was silent. Her heart throbbed unpleasantly.</p>
<p>&quot;Jane is too good a girl for aught else,&quot; he resumed, the subject seeming to
impart to him some fictitious strength. &quot;She has borne all the obloquy in
patience and silence for my sake. Did you suppose, Mary, that the favourite
pupil of the Grey Ladies, trained by <i>them</i>, could have turned out
unworthily?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You should, at least, have confided this to Miss Hallet, Harry.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No; to her the least of all. Miss Hallet has her pride and her notions, and
would have proclaimed it in the marketplace.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I seem not to comprehend yet,&quot; replied Mary, many remembrances crowding upon
her. In point of fact, she scarcely knew whether to believe him. &quot;Last
winter--yes, and since then, Harry--you appeared to be seeking Ethel Reene for
your wife.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I once had an idea of Ethel. I knew not that the warm affection I felt for
her was but that of a brother: when I fell in love with Jane I learnt the truth.
My teasings of Ethel have been but jest, Mary: pursued to divert attention from
my intimacy with my real love, my wife.&quot;</p>
<p>Mary Ursula sighed. Harry had always been random and blamable in some way or
other. What a blow this would be for the Master of Greylands!</p>
<p>&quot;You will let her come in, Mary! Are you doubting still?&quot; he resumed, noting
her perplexed countenance. &quot;Why, Mary Ursula, had my relations with Jane been
what the world assumed, can you imagine I should have had the hardihood to
intrude my brazen face here amid the Sisters when she was taken ill? I have my
share of impudence, I am told; but I have certainly not enough for that. I
sought that minute's interview with Jane to bid her be firm--to bear all
reproaches, spoken and unspoken, for my sake and my father's peace. The only
wonder to me and to Jane also, has been that nobody ever suspected the truth.&quot;</p>
<p>Mary Ursula left the room. Jane was leaning against the wall outside in the
semi-darkness, a picture of quiet tribulation. Too conscious of the estimation
in which she was held, she did not dare assert herself. The lantern, which
nobody had put out, stood on the passage slab: there was no other light. Mary
drew her into the parlour--which was wholly dark, save for the reflected light
that came in from the lantern. So much the better. Jealous for the honour of her
family, Mary Ursula was feeling the moment bitterly, and her face would have
shown that she was.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Harry Castlemaine has been making a strange communication to me,&quot; she
began. &quot;He says he has married you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, madam, it is true,&quot; returned Jane hysterically, the sudden revulsion of
feeling at finding it was known, the relief from her miserable concealment,
taking vent in a flood of tears. &quot;We were married last November.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;By whom?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Parson Marston,&quot; sobbed Jane. &quot;He married us in his church at Stilborough.&quot;</p>
<p>Surprise, resentment, condemnation of Parson Marston, overpowered Miss
Castlemaine and kept her silent. Thinking of this inferior girl--very inferior
as compared with The Castlemaines--as they had all been thinking lately, it was
not in human nature that Mary should not feel it strongly. She had her share of
the Castlemaine pride; though she had perhaps thought that it was laid down
within her when she came out of her home at Stilborough to enter the Grey
Nunnery.</p>
<p>&quot;It was very strange of Mr. Marston; very wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>Jane's sobs did not allow her to make any rejoinder. Of course it was wrong:
nobody felt more assured of that than Jane. She did not dare to tell how Harry
Castlemaine's masterful will had carried all with him, including herself and the
parson. Jane had perhaps been quite willing to be carried; and the parson
yielded to &quot;You must,&quot; and was besides reprehensibly indifferent. &quot;He would only
have taken the girl off to a distance and got tied up by a strange parson,&quot; was
Mr. Marston's excuse later, when speaking of it. &quot;I am not to blame; I didn't
set afloat the marriage.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How long should you have kept it secret?&quot; asked Miss Castlemaine, looking at
Jane in her distress.</p>
<p>&quot;As long as my husband had wished me to keep it, madam,&quot; was the sobbing
answer. &quot;He was always hoping some occasion might arise for declaring it; but he
did not like to vex Mr. Castlemaine. It was my aunt's not knowing it that
grieved me most.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I almost wonder you did not tell Sister Mildred when you were here,&quot;
observed Mary, musing on the past.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh if I had been able to tell her!&quot; returned the girl, impulsively clasping
her hands. &quot;It was very hard to bear, madam, all that blame; but I tried to be
patient. And many might have thought nearly as ill of me for letting one so much
above me make me his wife.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Has no one at all known it?&quot; asked Mary.</p>
<p>&quot;Only old Mrs. Dance. She has known it from the first. We used to meet at her
cottage.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, Jane, what is done cannot be undone. You are his wife, it seems, and
have been undeserving of the reproach of light conduct passed upon you. So far I
am, for your sake, glad. He has asked to see you. You can go in.&quot;</p>
<p>So Jane Hallet--no longer Hallet, however,--crept into the chamber, where her
husband lay dying, and stood by his side, her heart breaking.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't grieve, Jane, more than you can help,&quot; he said, clasping her hand.
&quot;This will answer one good end: you will be cleared.&quot;</p>
<p>She fell on her knees, weeping silent tears. &quot;To save your life I would
remain under the cloud for ever,&quot; she sighed. &quot;Oh, is there no hope?--is there
no hope?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, we shall see: the doctor will be here soon,&quot; said Harry evasively.
&quot;There! dry your tears, Jane; take heart, my dear.&quot;</p>
<p>And the doctor came without much further delay, and examined his patient, and
found that a bullet had lodged itself within him.</p>
<p>&quot;There must be an operation,&quot; said he, smoothing over his grave face. And he
hastened to despatch a messenger on a fleet horse for Surgeon Croft, the most
clever operating surgeon in Stilborough.</p>
<p>But Mr. Parker knew quite well that there remained no hope in this world for
Harry Castlemaine.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h4><a name="div1_36" href="#div1Ref_36">CHAPTER XXXVI.</a></h4>
<h5>GONE!</h5>
<br>

<p>Morning dawned. The Grey Nunnery was like a fair. What with the doctors and
their gigs, for two surgeons came from Stilborough, and the Sisters passing in
and out on various errands, and the excited people who assembled in numbers
round the gates, a stranger might have wondered at the commotion. More than once
had Greylands been excited during the year now swiftly approaching its close,
but never as much as now. A dreadful encounter between smugglers and the
preventive men! and Harry Castlemaine shot down by one of their stray bullets!
and Jane Hallet come to life again!</p>
<p>The Master of Greylands sat by the dying couch, giving vent now and again to
his dire distress. There was no hope for his son; he knew it from the medical
men: and his son had been the one only thing he had much cared for in life.</p>
<p>Of all the blows that had fallen on James Castlemaine, none had been like
unto this. The shock alone was terrible. It reached him first through one of
those Grey Sisters against whom he had been so prejudiced. Sister Ann had gone
running over to knock up the Dolphin, lest cordials, or else, which the Nunnery
lacked, might be required for the wounded man. After arousing John Bent and
telling the news, she sped onwards under the night stars, to apprise the Master
of Greylands. Greylands' Rest lay still and quiet; its doors and windows closed,
the blinds drawn down. Sister Ann rang, and was immediately answered inside by
the bark of a dog. &quot;Cesar, Cesar!&quot; she called out at the top of her voice, to
assure the dog that it was a friend; and Cesar, recognising the tones, ceased
his bark, which was impolitic on Sister Ann's part, for if he had kept on
barking it would have aroused the inmates. Sister Ann waited and rang again; and
then, terrified at the thought that the Master of Greylands might be too late to
see his son, she retreated a few steps and shouted up to the windows. The Master
heard it, and appeared looking out.</p>
<p>&quot;Who is it?--what is it?&quot; he asked, leaning from the window he had thrown up,
and recognising with astonishment the dress of a Grey Sister.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, sir, it's bad news!&quot; replied Sister Ann, &quot;but I'm thankful to have awoke
you. It's ill news about Mr. Harry, sir: and I've run all the way here, and am
out of breath.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What ill news about Mr. Harry?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He has been brought to the Nunnery wounded dreadfully. I've come up to ask
you to make haste, sir, if you'd see him; for he may be bleeding to death.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wounded?--how?&quot; gasped the Master, feeling as bewildered as a woman, and
perhaps hard of belief.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been a frightful fight to-night, they say, with smugglers, sir.
Mr. Nettleby and two of the coastguardsmen brought him in. We don't know what to
believe or think.&quot;</p>
<p>With a muttered word to the effect that he would go to the Nunnery directly,
the Master of Greylands shut the window. Dressing in haste, he went forth on his
errand. Of the two ways to the Nunnery, the Chapel Lane was somewhat the nearer
one; and he took it. He bared his aching head to the night-air as he traversed
it with fleet strides, wondering what extent of misery he might be entering
upon. No very long space of time had elapsed since he sat in his room dwelling
on the misfortunes and the deaths that the year had brought forth. Was there to
be yet further misfortune?--another death? A death to him more cruel than any
that had gone before it?</p>
<p>As he neared the turning to the Hutt, he dashed down the opening and tried
the house-door and shouted--just as Sister Ann had tried and shouted at the door
of Greylands' Rest some minutes before. The door was fast, and no response came:
and the Master knocked at the little window that belonged to Teague's
bedchamber. &quot;Not back yet,&quot; he murmured to himself, after waiting barely a
moment, and dashed back again and on towards the Nunnery. And there he fennel
his worst fears as to Harry realised, and learnt from Mr. Parker that there was
no hope of saving him.</p>
<p>The bleeding had been then stopped by Mr. Parker, but Harry had fainted.
Before he revived and was collected enough to speak, or perhaps strong enough,
the other surgeons came, and not one private word had been exchanged between
father and son.</p>
<p>With the morning Harry was better. Better in so far as that he lay at
tolerable ease and could converse at will. The surgeons had done for him what
little could be done; but his life was only a question of hours. In a distress,
the like of which he had never before experienced, sat the Master of Greylands.
His handsome, noble, attractive son, of whom he had been so proud, whom he had
so beloved in his heart, was passing away from his sight for ever. His chair was
drawn close to the couch, his hand lay on Harry's, his aching eyes rested on the
pale, changed face. The whole world combined could not have wrought for him a
trial such as this: his own death would have been as nothing to it: and the blow
unnerved him.</p>
<p>They were alone together: none intruded unnecessarily on these closing hours.
Harry gave briefly the history of the scene of the past night, thanking heaven
aloud that his father was not present at it.</p>
<p>&quot;The two first boats had not long been in, and not half their packages were
landed, when another boat glided quietly up,&quot; said Harry. &quot;I thought it was from
the vessel with more goods, till I heard a shout in Nettleby's tones 'In the
King's name,' and found the revenue men were leaping out of her. I ran to close
the passage to Teague's, and was coming back again when I found myself struck
here,&quot; touching his side. &quot;The pain was horrible: I knew what it meant--that I
was shot, and useless--and I slipped into the vaults, intending to get up to the
chapel ruins, and so away. I must have fainted there, and fallen; for I remember
nothing more until Nettleby and the rest were bringing me here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They found you lying there?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not they. Mary Ursula.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mary Ursula!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It seems so. She was there with a lantern, I gather. Father, you will,
doubtless, learn all the explanation you wish; I cannot give it. You know what
this shot has done for me?&quot;</p>
<p>The Master did not answer.</p>
<p>&quot;It is my death. I forced Croft to tell me. By to-night all will be over.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Castlemaine, striving and struggling to maintain composure, broke down
helplessly at the last words, and sobbed aloud with an emotion never before
betrayed by him to man. The distress to Harry was all too great; he had been
truly attached to his indulgent father.</p>
<p>&quot;For my sake, father!--for the little time I have to stay!&quot; he said,
imploringly. And the Master smothered his grief as he best might.</p>
<p>With his hand held between his father's, and his sad eyes beseeching pardon
for the offence which in strong life he had dreaded to tell, Harry Castlemaine
made his confession: Jane Hallet was his wife. It was somewhat of a shock, no
doubt, to the Master of Greylands, but it fell with comparative lightness on his
ear: beside the one vast trouble close at hand, others seemed as nothing. Jane
might be his son's wife; but his son would not live to own her as such to the
world.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you forgive me, father? That it was wrong, I am aware; but only myself
know how dearly I grew to love her. The place has been heaping scorn upon her,
but she bore it all for my sake, knowing she would be cleared when I could
declare it to you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She has not deserved the scorn, then?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Never. I would not have sought to hurt a hair of her head. Say you forgive
me, father!--the moments are passing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, yes, I forgive you; I forgive you. Oh, my boy, I forgive all. I wish I
could die instead of you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And--will you set her right with the world?&quot; continued Harry, holding his
father's hand against his cheek caressingly. &quot;It is only you who can effectually
do it, I think. And allow her a little income to maintain her in comfort?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Harry, I will do all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She is my wife, you see, father, and it is what should be. Your promise will
ease my soul in dying. Had I lived, she would have shared my state and fortune.</p>
<p>&quot;All, all; I will do all,&quot; said the Master of Greylands.</p>
<p>&quot;For the past, it is not she who is to blame,&quot; continued Harry, anxious that
there should be no misapprehension of Jane's conduct. &quot;She would have held out
against the marriage on account of my family, always begging of me to wait. But
I would have my way. Do not visit the blame upon her, father, for she does not
deserve it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I understand: she shall have all justice, Harry. Be at peace.&quot;</p>
<p>But, in spite of this one absorbing grief for his son, there was another care
that kept intruding itself in no minor degree on the Master of Greylands: and
that was the business connected with the smugglers. How much of that was
known?--how much had good fortune been enabled to keep concealed? While the
doctors were again with Harry towards midday, Mr. Castlemaine snatched a moment
to go out of doors.</p>
<p>How strange the broad glare of day appeared to him! Coming out of the
darkened room with its hushed atmosphere, its overlying sadness, into the light
of the sun, high in the heavens, the hum of the crowding people, the stir of
health and busy life, the Master of Greylands seemed to have passed into another
world. The room he had left was as the grave, where his son would soon be; this
moving scene as some passing pageantry, very redolent of mundane earth.</p>
<p>Which Greylands was making the most of,--the strange accident to Harry
Castlemaine (every whit as strange as the self-shooting that had temporarily
disabled young Dance; nay, stranger); or the astounding news touching the
smugglers, or the reappearance of Jane Hallet--it was hard to say. All kinds of
reports were afloat; some true, some untrue, as usual. Mr. Superintendent,
Nettleby, it appeared, had for a considerable time suspected that smuggling to
an extraordinary extent was carried on somewhere along this line of coast. From
information supplied to him, he had little doubt that valuable goods found their
contraband entrance, somewhere; within, say, the length of a dozen miles. The
difficulty was--how to hit upon the spot. Surmises were chiefly directed to the
little place called Beeton, a mile or two higher up. It presented unusual
facilities for running contraband goods; slight incidents occurred from time to
time that seemed to bear out the superintendent's suspicions of it; and his
chief attention was directed to that place. It was directed to any spot rather
than Greylands. Greylands, in the estimation of the revenue-men, was exempt from
suspicion, or nearly exempt. Save the open beach, there was no spot at Greylands
where a cargo could be run--and the superintendent took care that the beach
should be protected. Not an idea existed that the little strip of beach under
the old Friar's Keep could be made available for anything of the kind, or that
it had a passage of communication with Commodore Teague's Hutt, or with any
other place in the world. Counting on his ten fingers, Mr. Nettleby could number
up fifteen months during which he had beset Beeton like a watchdog, and nothing
at all had come of it. The unsuspected Greylands had been left at ease, as
usual, to do what it would.</p>
<p>Upon Greylands the news fell like a thunderbolt. Had one of those
cloud-electric missives suddenly fallen and shattered the rocks to pieces, it
would not have caused more intense astonishment. The Friar's Keep been used as a
place of smuggling for untold years!--and Commodore Teague was the head
smuggler!--who used to stow away the goods in his big cellar till he could take
them away in his spring cart! Greylands knew not how to believe this: and on the
Commodore's score somewhat resented it, for he was an immense favourite. One
fact seemed indisputable--the Commodore was not to be seen this morning, and his
place was shut up.</p>
<p>The version generally believed was this. Mr. Superintendent Nettleby,
observing, after dark had fallen, a suspicious-looking vessel lying nearly close
in shore, and having had his attention directed to this same vessel once or
twice before, had collected his men and taken up his place in the revenue-boat,
under cover of the walls of the Grey Nunnery, and there waited until it was time
to drop upon the smugglers: which he did, catching them in the act. Most of the
men he surprised were sailors; he knew it by their attire and language; but
there was at least one other man (if not two men) who was muffled up for
disguise; and there was, without any disguise, working openly, Commodore Teague.
The Commodore and these other men--take them at two--had escaped to the ship,
and neither the superintendent nor his subordinates knew who they were. The
wounded sailor-prisoner was a foreigner, who could speak but a few words of
English. He gave his name as Jacob Blum, and appeared to know little about the
affair, declaring solemnly that he had joined the vessel in Holland only a month
before, and was not apprised that she was in the contraband trade.</p>
<p>But Harry Castlemaine--what caused him to be so fatally mixed up with the
fight? Lacking an authorised version, the following sprung up; and, spreading
from one to another, was soon accepted as truth. Mr. Harry, promenading about
late in the night with his sweetheart, Jane Hallet (and sly enough she must have
been, to have stayed all this while at old Goody Dance's, and never shown
herself!), had his ears saluted with the noise and shots going on below. He
rushed into the Keep and down the staircase to the vaults beneath (instinct
having discovered the stairs to him at the right moment, as was supposed), where
he was met and struck down by a stray shot, the fighters not even knowing that
he was there. Jane Hallet must have followed him. Sister Mary Ursula's
appearance on the scene, as mentioned by the two coastguardsmen, was accounted
for in the same natural manner. She had heard the disturbance from her
chamber-window--for of course the noise penetrated as far as the Grey
Nunnery--and had gone forth, like a brave, good woman, to ascertain its meaning
and see if succour was needed.</p>
<p>All these several reports--which running from one to another, grew into
assured facts, as just said, in men's minds--were listened to by Mr.
Castlemaine. He found that, as yet, not a shade of suspicion was directed to him
or his house: he fervently hoped that it might not be. That would be one sup
taken out of his cup of bitterness. Commodore Teague was regarded as the sole
offender, so far as Greylands was concerned.</p>
<p>&quot;To think that we should have been so deceived in any man!&quot; exclaimed the
landlord of the Dolphin, standing outside his door with his wife, and addressing
Mr. Castlemaine and the crowd together. &quot;I'd have believed anybody in the place
to be a cheat, sir, rather than Teague.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We have not had Teague's defence yet,&quot; spoke the Master of Greylands. &quot;It is
not right to entirely condemn a man unheard.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But the coastguardsmen saw him there at work, sir,&quot; retorted ready-tongued
Mrs. Bent. &quot;Henry Mann says he was hard at it with his shirt sleeves stripped
up. He'd not be helping for love: he must have had his own interest there.&quot;</p>
<p>The Master of Greylands was wisely silent. To defend Teague too much might
have turned suspicion on himself: at least, he fancied so in his
self-consciousness: and the probability was that the Commodore would never
return to ascertain how he stood with Greylands.</p>
<p>In the course of the morning, making rather more commotion with its sail than
usual, Tom Dance's fishing-boat came sailing in. Tom and his son were on board
her, and a fair haul of fish. The various items of strange news were shouted out
to it by half a dozen tongues as soon as it was within hailing distance. Tom
gave vent to sundry surprised ejaculations in return, as he found the cable and
made the boat fast, and landed with a face of astonishment. The one item that
seemed most to stagger him was the state of Mr. Harry Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;It can't be true!&quot; he cried, standing still, while a change passed over his
countenance. &quot;Shot by smugglers!--dying! Mr. Harry Castlemaine!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, you see, Tom, it might ha' been them preventive-men,--'twarn't obliged
to ha' been they smugglers,&quot; said Jack Tuff. &quot;Both sides was firing off, by all
account, as thick as thieves. Which ever 'twas, Mr. Harry have got his
death-shot. How wet your jersey is!&quot;</p>
<p>Tom Dance turned in at his own door, threw off the &quot;jersey&quot; and other
articles of his fishing toggery, flung on dry things, and went up towards the
throng round the Dolphin. Mr. Castlemaine was just crossing back to the Nunnery,
and looked at him, some involuntary surprise in his eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Is it you, Dance?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's me, sir: just got in with the tide. I be struck stupid, pretty nigh,
hearing what they've been telling me, down there,&quot; added Tom, indicating the
beach.</p>
<p>&quot;Ay, no doubt,&quot; said the Master of Greylands, in a subdued tone. But he
walked on, saying no more.</p>
<p>Tom Dance's confrres in the fishing trade had no idea but that he had sailed
out in the ordinary way with the night tide. The reader knows that at midnight
he was at least otherwise occupied. Tom had done a somewhat daring act. He and
his son, alike uninjured in the fray, had escaped in the ship's boats; and Tom,
flinging off his disguising cape and cap, his sea boots, and in fact most of his
other attire, leaped into the water to swim to his fishing-boat, lying on the
open beach. It was his one chance of non-discovery. He felt sure that neither he
nor Walter had been recognized by Nettleby and his men; but, if they were to go
off to Holland in the ship and so absent themselves from Greylands, it would at
once be known that they were the two who had been seen taking part. No man in
Greylands was so good a swimmer as Dance; and----he resolved to risk it. He
succeeded. After somewhat of a battle, and the water was frightfully cold, he
gained his boat. It had just floated with the incoming tide. By means of one of
the ropes, of which there were several hanging over the side, he climbed on
board, put on some of his sea-toggery that was there, and slipped the cable. The
anchor was small, not at all difficult for one man to lift; but Tom Dance wanted
to save both time and noise, and it was easiest to slip the cable. The moderate
breeze was in his favour blowing off the land. He hoisted the staysail, and was
soon nearing the ship, which was already spreading her canvas for flight. From
the ship Dance took his son on board. They stayed out all night, fishing: it was
necessary, to give a colouring to things and avert suspicion; and they had now,
close upon midday, come in with a tolerable haul of fish. Walter had orders to
stay on board, occupy himself there, and <i>be still</i>, while Tom landed to
gather news and to see which way the wind lay.</p>
<p>But he had never thought to hear these sad tidings about Harry Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;It has a'most done me up,&quot; he said, returning on board again and speaking to
his son. &quot;He was the finest young fellow in the country, and the freest in heart
and hand. And to be struck like this!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How much is known, father?&quot; asked Walter, stopping in his employment of
sorting the fish.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing's known that I can hear,&quot; growled Tom Dance, for he was feeling the
crossness of affairs just then. &quot;It's all laid on Teague's back--as Teague
always good-naturedly said it would be, if a blow-up came.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can Teague ever come back, father?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Teague don't want to. Teague has said oftentimes that he'd as soon, or
sooner, be over among the Dutch than here. He was always ready for the start, I
expect. He'll be writing for us to go over and see him next summer.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know he liked them foreign towns: he's often been in 'em,&quot; observed
Walter. &quot;And he mist have feathered his nest pretty well.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes; he won't need to look about him for his pipe and chop of a day. Our
chief nest-egg is smashed though, lad. No more secret night-work for us ever
again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, you must have feathered the nest too, father,&quot; returned Walter,
privately glad that the said night-work was over, for he had never liked it in
his heart.</p>
<p>&quot;You just hold your tongue about the feathering of nests,&quot; sharply
reprimanded Tom. &quot;Once let folks fancy I've got more than fishing would bring
in, and they might set on to ask where it come from. <i>Your</i> nest won't be
feathered by me, I can tell ye, young man, unless you keep a still tongue in
your head.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There's no fear of me, father.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And there'd better not be,&quot; concluded Tom Dance. &quot;I'd ship ye off after
Teague, short and quick, if I thought there was.&quot;</p>
<br>

<p>The afternoon was drawing to its close. On the rude couch, more exhausted
than he had been in the morning, getting every minute now nearer to death, lay
Harry Castlemaine. His stepmother, Flora, Ethel, good old Sister Mildred, and
Mary Ursula, all had taken their last farewell of him. Mrs. Bent had contrived
to get in, and had taken hers with some bitter tears. Mr. Parker had just gone
out again: the Sister in attendance, perceiving what was at hand, had soon
followed him. The poor wife, Jane, only acknowledged to be left, had gone
through her last interview with her husband and said her last adieu. Nearly
paralysed with grief, suffering from undue excitement which had been repressed
so long, she had relapsed into a state of alarming prostration, that seemed
worse than faintness. Mr. Parker administered an opiate, and she was now lying
on her old bed above, cared for by Sister Mildred. And the sole watcher by the
dying bed was Mr. Castlemaine.</p>
<p>Oh, what sorrow was his! The only living being he had greatly cared for in
the world dying before his aching eyes. It was for him he had lived, had
schemed, had planned and hoped. That nefarious smuggling had been only carried
on in reference to Harry's prospective wealth. But for Harry's future position,
that Mr. Castlemaine had so longed to establish on a high footing, he had thrown
it up long before. It was all over now; the secret work, the hope, and the one
cherished life.</p>
<p>&quot;Father, don't!&quot; panted Harry, as Mr. Castlemaine sat catching up ever and
anon his breath in sobs, though his eyes were dry. &quot;It may be better for me to
go. I used to look forward, I've often done it, to being a good son to you in
your old age: but it may be best as it is.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Castlemaine could not trust himself to answer.</p>
<p>&quot;And you'll forgive me for all the trouble I've cost you! As I trust God has
forgiven me. I have been thinking of <i>Him</i> all day, father.&quot;</p>
<p>A terrible sob now. Mr. Castlemaine knew not how to keep down his emotion.
Oh, how bitter it was to him, this closing hour, his heart aching with its pain!</p>
<p>&quot;It won't be so very long, father; you'll be coming, you know: and it is a
journey that we must all take. What's the matter?--it's getting dark!&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Castlemaine raised his eyes to the window. The light was certainly fading
on the panes; the dusk was stealing over the winter afternoon. Harry could only
speak at intervals, and the words came out with long pauses between them. Mr.
Castlemaine fancied he was beginning slightly to wander: but a great many of us
are apt to fancy that when watching the dying.</p>
<p>&quot;And you'll take care of Jane, father? Just a little help, you know, to keep
her from being thrown on the world. It's not much she'll want I don't ask it.&quot;</p>
<p>The damp hand, lying in Mr. Castlemaine's was, pressed almost to pain; but
there was no other answer. The aching heart was well-nigh unmanned.</p>
<p>&quot;And don't be angry with Marston, father: he only did what I made him do. He
is a better man than we have thought him. He was very good to me when he was
here to-day, and left me comfort.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Castlemaine lodged his elbow on his knee, and bent his brow upon his
hand. For some time there was silence. Harry, who had none of the restlessness
sometimes characteristic of the final scene, lay quite still, his eyes closed.</p>
<p>A very long, deep breath disturbed the silence. It startled Mr. Castlemaine.
He looked up, and for a moment loosed the hand he held.</p>
<p>&quot;Harry!&quot;</p>
<p>Harry Castlemaine, his eyes wide open now, raised his head from the pillow.
He seemed to be staring at the windowpanes with a fixed look, as though he could
see the sea that lay beyond, and found something strange in it.</p>
<p>&quot;Father, dear father, it is she!&quot; he burst out in his natural tones, and with
a deep, exulting joy in them. &quot;It is my mother: I know her well. Oh, yes,
mother, I am coming!&quot;</p>
<p>The Master of Greylands was startled. Harry had never seen his mother to
remember her; he knew her only by her picture, which hung in one of the rooms,
and was a speaking likeness of her. Harry had fallen back again, and lay with a
smile upon his face. One more deep respiration came slowly forth from his lips:
it was the last he had to take in this world.</p>
<p>The bereaved father saw what it was, and all his bitter sorrow rose up within
him in one long overwhelming agony. He fell upon the unconscious face lying
there; his trial seeming greater than he could bear.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Harry, my son! my son Harry! would God I could have died for thee, my
son, my son!&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>

<h5>ANTHONY.</h5>
<br>

<p>Little explanation need be afforded in regard to the smuggling practices, so
long carried on with impunity. Some ten or fifteen years before, Commodore
Teague (commodore by courtesy) had taken the Hutt of old Mr. Castlemaine, on
whose land it stood. Whether the Commodore had fixed on his abode there with the
pre-intention to set up in the contraband trade, so much favoured then and so
profitable, or whether the facilities which the situation presented for it,
arising from the subterranean passage to the beach, which Teague himself
discovered, and which had been unknown to the Castlemaines, first induced the
thought, cannot be told. Certain it is, that Teague did organize and embark in
it; and was joined in it by James Castlemaine. James Castlemaine was a young and
active man then, ever about; and Teague probably thought that it would not do to
run the risk of being <i>found out</i> by the Castlemaines. He made a merit of
necessity; and by some means induced James Castlemaine to join him in the
work--to be his partner in it, in fact. Half a loaf is better than no bread,
runs the proverb, and the Commodore was of that opinion. His proposal was a
handsome one. James Castlemaine was to take half the gross profits; he himself
would take the risk, the cost, and the residue of the profits. Perhaps James
Castlemaine required little urging: daring, careless, loving adventure, the
prospect presented charms for him that nothing else could have brought. And the
compact was made.</p>
<p>It was never disclosed to his father, old Anthony Castlemaine, or to Peter,
the banker, or to any other of his kith and kin, his son Harry excepted. As
Harry grew to manhood and settled down at Greylands' Rest, after his education
was completed, the same cause that induced the Commodore to confide in James
Castlemaine induced the latter to confide in his son--namely, that Harry might,
one of these fine nights, be finding it out for himself. Harry delighted in it
just as much as his father had, and took an active part in the fun a great deal
oftener than his father did. Harry rarely allowed a cargo to be run without him;
Mr. Castlemaine, especially of late years, was only occasionally present. Few
men plotting against His Majesty's revenues had ever enjoyed so complete an
immunity from exposure. James Castlemaine and the Commodore had, to use young
Dance's expression, pretty well feathered their nests: and Tom Dance--who had
been taken into confidence from the first, for the help of a strong man was
needed by Teague to stow away the cargoes after they were run--had not done
amiss in his small way.</p>
<p>It was over now. The fever and the excitement, the hidden peril and the
golden harvest, all had come to an end, and Harry Castlemaine's life bad ended
with them. Striding over the field path that led to Greylands' Rest, his heart
softened almost like a little child's, his tears running slowly down his cheeks
unchecked, went the Master of Greylands from his son's death-bed.</p>
<p>&quot;Is it retribution?&quot; he murmured, lifting his face in the gloom of the
evening. &quot;Harry's death following upon Anthony's ere the year is out!&quot; And he
struck his forehead as he walked on.</p>
<p>&quot;I beg your pardon, sir, for speaking at this moment. May I say how truly I
feel for you? I would not like you to think me indifferent to this great
sorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>The speaker was George North. They had met in the most lonely part of the
road, just before the turning into the avenue close to the house gates. George
North did not know that the death had actually taken place; only that it was
expected ere long. All his sympathies were with Mr. Castlemaine: he had been
feeling truly for him and for Harry during the day; and in the impulse of the
moment, meeting thus unexpectedly, he stopped to express it.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Mr. Castlemaine, quite humbly, drawing his hand across his
face. &quot;Yes, it is a bitter blow. The world's sunshine has gone out for me with
it.&quot;</p>
<p>A rapid thought came to George North. What if, in this softened mood, he were
to ask for a word of Anthony? If ever the Master of Greylands could be induced
to afford information of his fate, it would be now: no other moment might ever
occur so favourable as this. Yes, he <i>would;</i> be the result what it might.</p>
<p>&quot;Forgive me Mr. Castlemaine. There is a matter that I have long wished to
mention to you; a question I would ask: the present, now that we are alone here,
and both softened by sorrow--for believe me I do sorrow for your son more than
you may suspect--seems to me to be an appropriate time. May I dare to ask it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ask anything,&quot; said the unconscious mourner.</p>
<p>&quot;Can you tell me what became of young Anthony Castlemaine?&quot;</p>
<p>Even in the midst of his anguish, the question gave the Master of Greylands a
sharp sting. &quot;What do you know about Anthony Castlemaine?&quot; he rejoined.</p>
<p>&quot;He was my--dear friend,&quot; spoke George in agitation. &quot;If you would but tell
me, sir, what became of him! Is he really dead?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh that he were not dead!&quot; cried Mr. Castlemaine, unmanned by the past
remembrances, the present pain. &quot;He would have been some one to care for; I
could have learnt to love him as my nephew. I have no one left now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You have still a nephew, sir!&quot; returned George, deeply agitated, a sure
conviction seating itself within him at the last words, that whatever might have
been the adverse fate of Anthony, the sorrowing man before him had not helped to
induce it. &quot;A nephew who will ask nothing better than to serve you in all
affection and duty--if you will but suffer him.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Castlemaine looked keenly at the speaker in the evening's gloaming.
&quot;Where is this nephew?&quot; he inquired after a pause.</p>
<p>&quot;I am he, sir. I am George Castlemaine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Uncle James--if I may dare so to address you. I am poor Anthony's
brother.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And my brother Basil's son?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;His younger son, Uncle James. They named me George North.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;George North Castlemaine,&quot; repeated Mr. Castlemaine, as if wishing to
familiarise himself with the name. &quot;And you have been staying here with a view
of tracing out Anthony's fate?&quot; he added, quickly arriving at the conclusion,
and feeling by rapid instinct that this young man was in good truth his nephew.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I have, sir And I had begun to despair of doing it. Is he still
living?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, lie is dead. He died that fatal February night that you have heard of.
You have heard talk of the shot: that shot killed him.&quot;</p>
<p>In spite of his effort for composure, George allowed a groan to escape his
lips. The Master of Greylands echoed it.</p>
<p>&quot;George, my nephew, it has been an unlucky year with the Castlemaines,&quot; he
said in a wailing tone. &quot;Death has claimed three of us; two of the deaths, at
least, have been violent, and all of them have been that sudden death we pray
against Sunday by Sunday in the Litany. My brother Peter; my nephew Anthony; and
now my son!&quot;</p>
<p>The suspicion, that had been looming in George's mind since the morning, rose
to the surface: a suspicion of more curious things than one.</p>
<p>&quot;I think I understand it,&quot; he said; &quot;I see it all. In some such affray with
the smugglers as occurred last night, Anthony met his death. A shot killed him;
as it has now killed another? A smuggler's shot?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A smuggler's shot--true. But there was no affray.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tell me all, Uncle James,&quot; said the young man, his beseeching tone amounting
to pain. &quot;Let me share all--the trouble and doings of the past. It shall be
hidden in my breast for ever.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What is it that you suspect?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That the smuggling trade was yours: and that the fact accounts for your
having been in the Keep that night--for Harry's being there yesterday. Trust me
as you have trusted your son, Uncle James: it shall be ever sacred. I will
sympathise with you as he has done: am I not a Castlemaine?&quot;</p>
<p>One rapid debate in his mind, and then the Master of Greylands pointed to his
garden and led the way to the nearest bench there: the selfsame bench that
George had sat on to whisper his love-vows to Ethel. He was about to disclose
all to his new-found nephew, to whom his esteem and admiration had before been
drawn as George North; whom he already liked, nay loved, by one of those subtle
instincts rarely to be accounted for. Unless he made a clean breast of all
things, the fate of Anthony must in some particulars still remain dark.</p>
<p>He first of all satisfied George upon the one point which has already been
declared to the reader: they were the smugglers, the Castlemaines, in
conjunction with the originator and active man, Teague: explaining to him how it
was that he had been induced to join himself to the practices. And then he went
on to other matters.</p>
<p>George Castlemaine sat by his side in the dusky night, and listened to the
tale. To more than he had dared to ask, or hope for, or even to think of that
eventful evening. For Mr. Castlemaine entered upon the question of the estate:
speaking at first abruptly.</p>
<p>&quot;Greylands' Rest is Anthony's,&quot; said he.</p>
<p>&quot;Anthony's!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. Or rather yours, now Anthony is gone; but it was his when he came over.
It is necessary for me to tell you this at first: one part of the story involves
another. My father knew nothing of the smuggling; never had an idea of it; and
the money that I gained by it I had to invest quietly from time to time through
a London agent; so that he, and others, should not know I possessed it. A few
weeks before my father died, he called me to him one morning to talk about the
property----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did he make a will?----I beg your pardon for my interruption, Uncle James,&quot;
hastily added the young man in apology for what now struck him for rudeness.</p>
<p>&quot;No, he did not make a will. He never made one. Your grandfather was one of
those men who shrink from making a will--there are many such in the world. It
was less necessary in his case to make one than it is in some cases--at least he
deemed it so. Of his available means, Basil had received his share, I had
received mine, Peter had had his; all, years before. Nothing, save the estate,
was left to will away. I see what you are wondering at, George--that out of
twelve or thirteen hundred a year--for that is about what the estate brings
in--your grandfather should have been able to live here so liberally and make
the show we did: but during his lifetime he enjoyed nearly as much more from a
relative of my mother's, which source of income went back at his death. Perhaps
you know this. My father began that morning to talk to me--'When do you expect
Basil, James?' he asked abruptly: and the question unutterably astonished me,
for we had not heard from Basil at all, and did not expect him. 'He will come,'
said my father; 'he will come. Basil will know that I must be drawing near my
end, and he will come over to be ready to take possession here.' 'Leave
Greylands' Rest for me, father,' I burst out--for I had been hoping all along
that it would be mine after him: I presume you see for why?&quot;</p>
<p>But George did not see: and said so.</p>
<p>&quot;On account of what went on in the Friar's Keep,&quot; explained Mr. Castlemaine.
&quot;It would not do, unless I gave up that, for me to quit this place, or for a
stranger to live at it. I knew Basil of old: he would just as soon have
denounced it to the world as not. And, as I was not then inclined to give up
anything so profitable, I wished to have Greylands' Rest. There is no other
residence within miles of the place that would have been suitable for me and my
family.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And would my grandfather not leave it to you, Uncle James?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He refused absolutely. He would not listen to me. Greylands' Rest must
descend to Basil after him, he said, and to Basil's son--if Basil had a
son--after <i>him</i>. I begged him to let me purchase Greylands' Rest at a fair
valuation, and pay over the money to him or invest it for Basil. I said I was
attached to the place, having lived in it all my life; whereas Basil had been
away from it years and years. I offered to add on to the purchase money any
premium that might be named; but the old man laughed, and asked where I was to
get all the money from. Of course he did not know of my private resources, and I
did not dare to allude to them. I brought up Peter's name, saying he would
assist me. Peter was rolling in riches then. But it was all of no use: Basil was
the eldest, my father said, the rightful heir, and the estate should never pass
over him for one of us. He drew up, himself, a sort of deed of gift, not a will,
giving the estate to Basil then; then, during his own lifetime; and he charged
me, should Basil not have appeared at the time of his demise, to remain in
possession and keep it up for him. But he never charged me--mark you, George, he
never charged me to seek Basil out. And, for the matter of that, we did not know
where to seek him.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Castlemaine paused to take his hat off and wipe his brow. This confession
must be costing him some pain. But for the greater pain at his heart, the
hopeless despair that seemed to have fallen on the future, it had never been
made.</p>
<p>&quot;My father died. I, according to his pleasure, remained on, the Master of
Greylands' Rest. People took it for granted it was left to me; I never gave a
hint to the contrary, even to my brother Peter. Peter was getting into
embarrassment then with his undertakings of magnitude, and came to me for money
to help him. The time went on; each month as it passed and brought no sign of
Basil, no tidings of him, seeming to confirm me more securely in possession of
the property. My father had said to me, 'Should Basil never reappear to claim
it, nor any son of Basil's, then it will be yours, James.' Before the first year
came to an end, I thought it was mine; as the second year advanced, it seemed so
securely my own that I never gave a thought or a fear to its being taken from
me. You may judge, then, what I felt when some young fellow presented himself
one day at Greylands' Rest, without warning of any kind, saying Basil was dead,
that he was Basil's son, and had come to claim the property.&quot;</p>
<p>Again the Master of Greylands paused. But this time he remained quite still.
George did not interrupt him.</p>
<p>&quot;When I recall the shame connected with that period, and would fain plead an
excuse for myself, I feel tempted to say that the excuse lay in the suddenness
of the blow. You must not think me covetous, George Castlemaine: love of money
had nothing whatever to do with the assertion to Anthony that Greylands' Rest
was mine. I dreaded to be turned from it. I wanted, at any cost (that of honour
you will say), to stay in it. At one of the interviews I had with your brother,
I hinted to him that compensation might be made to him for his disappointment,
<i>even to the value of the estate</i>, for I was rich and did not heed money.
But Anthony was a true Castlemaine, I found, Basil's own son: for he at once
replied that he required only justice: if the estate was his, he must have it;
if not his, he did not want to be recompensed for what he had no claim to. I was
angry, mortified, vexed: he kept asking me to show the Deed, or the Will, by
which I held it: I could not do that, for it would have been seen at once that
the property was his, not mine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps you have destroyed the Deed,&quot; said George.</p>
<p>&quot;No, I kept it. I have it still. It was always my intention to make
restitution some time, and I kept the Deed. My poor son would never have
succeeded to Greylands' Rest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who would then?&quot; exclaimed George involuntarily.</p>
<p>&quot;Anthony. I am speaking just now of what my thoughts and intentions were
during that brief period of Anthony's sojourn at Greylands. But now listen,
George. You must have heard that on the last day of your brother's life we had
an encounter in yonder field.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yes, I have heard of it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Something indoors had put me frightfully out of temper, and I was in a
haughty and angry mood. But, as Heaven is my judge, I resolved, later on in that
afternoon, to make him restitution: to give up to him the estate. After leaving
him, I went on; I was, I believe, in a foaming passion, and walked fast to throw
it of. In passing the churchyard, I saw that some one had been flinging some
dead sticks on my father's tombstone: you know it, of course: it is the large
one of white marble with the iron rails round: and I went in to clear them off.
How it was I know not: I suppose Heaven sends such messages to all of us: but as
I stood there to read the inscription, 'Anthony Castlemaine, of Greylands'
Rest,' all the folly and iniquity of my conduct rose up vividly to confront me.
I saw his fine old face before me again, I seemed to hear his voice, enjoining
me to hold the estate in trust for Basil, or Basil's son, and relying with the
utmost implicit trust on my honour that I would do this. A revulsion of feeling
came over me, my face flushed with its sense of shame. 'Father, I will obey
you,' I said aloud; 'before another day shall close, Greylands' Rest shall have
passed to young Anthony.' And it should so have passed. Heaven hears me say it,
and knows that I would have carried it out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am sure of it,&quot; said George, trustingly. It was impossible to doubt the
fervent accent, the earnest tone, so replete with pain.</p>
<p>&quot;I am now approaching that fatal point, the death of Anthony. When I went
back home, I sat down to consider of the future. Two plans suggested themselves
to me. The one was, to take Anthony into confidence as to the business
transacted at the Friar's Keep; the other was to give the business up
altogether, so far as I and Harry were concerned, and to make no disclosure of
it to Anthony. I rather inclined to the latter course: I had realized a vast
deal of money, and did not require more, and I thought it might be as well to
get out of the risk while we were undiscovered. Teague, who had made money also,
might give it up, or continue it on his sole score and at his own risk, as he
pleased. I thought of this all the evening, and between ten and eleven o'clock,
after the household had gone to bed, I went down to Teague's to speak to him
about it. I had no particular motive, you understand, for going to Teague at
that late hour, the morning would have been soon enough; but I had <i>thought</i>
myself into an impatient, restless mood, and so started off upon impulse. I
stayed with Teague, talking, until near half-past eleven, perhaps quite that: no
decision was come to, either by me or him, as to our respective course in regard
to the trade; but that made no difference to my intended communication to
Anthony as to the estate; and meant to send for him to Greylands' Rest as soon
as breakfast was over on the following morning. Do you believe me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fully, Uncle James. I believe every word you say.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am telling it before Heaven,&quot; was the solemn rejoinder. &quot;As in the
presence of my dead son.&quot;</p>
<p>And that was the first intimation George received that Harry was no more.</p>
<p>&quot;It was, I say, about half-past eleven when I left the Hutt. In turning into
Chapel Lane I saw a man standing there, holding on by one of the trees. It was
Jack Tuff, one of our working fishermen. He might have noticed me, though I
hoped he had not; for you will readily understand that I did not care for the
village to know of any night visits I might pay Teague. Upon reaching home I
went upstairs to my bureau, and sat for a few minutes, though I really can't say
how many, looking over some private papers connected with the trade. Mrs.
Castlemaine and the household had, I say, gone to rest. I began to feel tired; I
had not been well for some days; and shut the papers up until morning. Chancing
to look from the window before quitting the room, I saw a vessel at anchor, just
in a line with the chapel ruins. It was a remarkably bright, moonlight night.
The vessel looked like our vessel; the one engaged in the contraband trade; and
I knew that if it was so, she had come over unexpectedly, without notice, to
Teague. Such an occurrence was very unusual, though it had happened once or
twice before. I left the house again, passed down Chapel Lane, and went straight
over to the chapel ruins to take a nearer look at the vessel. Yes, I see what
you are thinking of, George--your brother and John Bent did see me. Bent's
assertion that they stood there and watched me across is true; though I did not
see them, and had no idea anyone was there. One glance was sufficient to show me
that it was in truth our vessel. I hastened through the Friar's Keep to the
secret door, and ran down the staircase. The cargo was already being run: the
boats were up on the beach, and the men were wading through the water with the
goods. Teague was not there, nor was Dance or his son: in fact, the sailors had
taken us by surprise. Without the delay of a moment, I ran up the subterranean
passage to summon Teague, and met him at the other end: he had just seen the
anchored vessel. Not many minutes was I away from the beach, George Castlemaine,
but when I got back, the mischief had been done. Anthony was killed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Murdered?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You may call it murder, if you like. His own imprudence, poor fellow,
induced it. It would appear--but we shall never know the exact truth--that he
must have discovered the staircase pretty quickly, and followed me down. In my
haste I had no doubt left the door open. At once he was in the midst of the
scene. The boats hauled up there, the goods already landed, the sailors at their
hasty work speaking together in covert whispers, must have told him what it
meant. In his honest impulse, but most fatal imprudence, he dashed forward amid
the sailor-smugglers. 'I have caught you, you illicit villains!' he shouted, or
words to that effect. 'I see what nefarious work you are engaged in: cheating
His Majesty's revenue. What, ho! coastguard!' Before the words had well left his
lips, one of the men caught up a pistol, presented it at him, and shot him
dead.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Castlemaine paused. His nephew, George, was silent from agitation.</p>
<p>&quot;The man who shot him was the mate of the vessel, a Dutchman by birth. When
Teague and I reached the beach, we saw them all standing over Anthony. He----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He was dead, you say?&quot; gasped George.</p>
<p>&quot;Stone dead. The bullet had gone through his heart. I cannot attempt to tell
you what my sensations were; but I would freely have given all I possessed, in
addition to Greylands' Rest, to recall the act. There was a short consultation
as to what was to be done with him; and, during this, one of the men drew a
diamond ring from poor Anthony's finger, on which the moonlight had flashed, and
put it into my hand. I have it still, shut up in my bureau.&quot;</p>
<p>George thought of this very ring--that Charlotte Guise had discovered and
told him of. She had been deeming it the one conclusive proof against Mr.
Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;I spoke of Christian burial for Anthony: but insuperable difficulties stood
in the way. It might have led to the discovery of the trade that was carried on;
and Van Stan, the man who killed him, insisted on his being thrown at once into
the sea.&quot;</p>
<p>George groaned. &quot;Was it done?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was. Van Stan, a huge, angular fellow, he was, with the strength of ten
ordinary men, cleared out one of the boats. They lifted Anthony into it; he was
rowed out to sea, and dropped into its midst. I can assure you, George, that for
many a day I looked for the sea to cast the body ashore: but it never has cast
it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where is that Van Stan?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Van Stan has died now in his turn. Big and strong giant though he was to
look at, he died in Holland not long after of nothing but a neglected cold. I
ought to have told you,&quot; added Mr. Castlemaine, &quot;that Teague went up nearly at
once to lock the gate of the chapel ruins: and there he saw John Bent pacing
about: which made us all the more cautions below to be as silent as might be. It
was our custom to lock that gate when cargoes were being run, both to guard
against surprise and against anyone coming into the ruins to look out to sea. We
had three keys to the gate: Teague kept one; Harry another; Dance a third.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wonder you could get three keys made to it without suspicion,&quot; spoke
George, amid his deeper thoughts.</p>
<p>&quot;We got a fresh lock and its keys from over the water, and had it put on the
gate without Greylands being the wiser. That was many a year ago.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And--you were not present!&quot; remarked George, his bewildered thoughts
recurring to the one fatal act of the night, and speaking like a man in a dream.</p>
<p>&quot;No. It was exactly as I have told you. My son was also away that night: he
had gone to Newerton. Had he or I been there, I don't know that we could have
hindered it: Van Stan gave no more warning of what he was about to do than does
a flash of lightning. Poor Anthony's own imprudence was in fault. He no doubt
supposed that he had suddenly come upon a nest of lawless wretches; and never
thought to connect them in any way with the Castlemaines.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Teague said that the shot that was heard by John Bent and others proceeded
from his gun. That was not true?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was not true. That he had been cleaning his gun that night, was so; for
when I reached the Hutt, I found him occupied at it. It was also true that he
was going out for a sail next day in his yacht----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And were you going with him as they said?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, I was not. But if I am to tell you all, I must proceed in my own way. I
went home that night, when the work was over, with Anthony's fate lying heavily
upon me. After a perfectly sleepless night I was disturbed in the early morning
by the news that my brother Peter was dead; and I started for Stilborough. In
the afternoon, when I came back, I found Greylands in a commotion. Miles, my
servant man, told me of the disappearance of Anthony, and he alluded indignantly
to the rumours connecting me with it. I had to meet these rumours; prudence
necessitated it; and I went to the Dolphin Inn, where the people had mostly
assembled, taking the Hutt on my way. The Hutt was shut up; Teague was not in
yet. On my way onwards I met him, just landed from his boat, and we stayed to
exchange opinions. 'Don't let it be known that you were out at all last night,
sir,' he said. 'Your man Miles sticks to it that you were not, and so must you.'
I should have taken this advice but for one circumstance--in for one lie in for
fifty, you know; and lies I was obliged to tell, to turn all scent from the
illicit trade. I told Teague that in quitting the Hutt the previous night at
half-past eleven, I had seen Tuff in the lane, and he might have recognised me.
So my visit to Teague had to be acknowledged and accounted for; it was the safer
plan; and in a word or two we settled what the plea should be--that I had gone
down to arrange about going for a sail with him the next morning in his yacht.
This I spoke of at the Dolphin; but other facts and rumours suggested against me
I ignored. It was a terrible time,&quot; passionately added Mr. Castlemaine. &quot;I never
recall it without pain.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It must have been,&quot; said George in his sympathy.</p>
<p>&quot;Teague went to the Dolphin later, but I had then left the inn. He said that
when he heard the people commenting on the shot, instinct prompted him to take
it on himself, and he there and then avowed that the report came from his own
gun. The scream he denied in toto, insisting upon it that it was all fancy.
Would it had been!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Would it had been!&quot; echoed George with a groan.</p>
<p>&quot;It was like a fate!&quot; burst forth the Master of Greylands, breaking the
distressing pause. &quot;Like a fate, that I should have gone into the Keep that
night by way of the chapel ruins. We always avoided that way of entrance and
egress, to keep observation from it. Harry, I know, had used it more than he
ought: it was so much more ready a way than going into Teague's and passing
through the long passage: but I was always cautioning him. The young are
careless.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The ghost of the Grey Monk?&quot; asked George. &quot;Who personated him? Of course I
can understand that the farce was kept up to scare the world from the Friar's
Keep.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just so. The superstition already existed in the village, and we turned it
to account. I recollect when I was a boy sundry old people testified to having
been at odd times scared by the apparition at the windows of the Keep when they
were passing it at night. We re-organised the ghost and caused him to show
himself occasionally, procuring for the purpose a monk's dress, and a lamp
emitting a pale blue flame by means of spirit and salt. Teague and Harry were
the actors; sometimes one, sometimes the other. It was an element of fun in my
poor boy's life.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Castlemaine rose with the last words. He had need of repose.</p>
<p>&quot;I will see you again in the morning, George. Come to me at what hour you
please, and I will introduce you to my wife by your true name. Greylands' Rest
is yours, you know, now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I--but I do not wish you to go out of it, Uncle James,&quot; said George in his
impulse of generosity.</p>
<p>&quot;I shall be only too glad to get out of it as soon as may be,&quot; was the
impressive answer. &quot;Do you think I could bear to live in it now? Would to Heaven
I had gone out of it before this fatal year! George,&quot; he added, with a gasp of
agitation, &quot;as I was walking home just now I asked myself whether the finger of
God had not been at work. These illicit practices of mine caused the death of
Anthony; I denied that death, concealed it, have attempted to ridicule it to the
world: and now my own and only son has died the same miserable death; been shot
down, perhaps, by the very selfsame pistol. It is retribution, lad.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wish I could comfort you!&quot; whispered George.</p>
<p>A moment's silence and Mr. Castlemaine recovered himself; his tone changed.</p>
<p>&quot;The revenues of the estate have been put by since nay father's death: left
for such a moment as this: I told you I did not mean to keep possession always.
They shall be paid over to you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They are not mine, Uncle James. Up to last February they were Anthony's.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Anthony is dead.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But he left a wife and child.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A wife and child! Anthony! Was it a boy? Perhaps I have spoken too fast.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is a girl,&quot; said George, not deeming it well to enter on the subject of
Madame Guise before the morrow. Mr. Castlemaine had been tried enough for one
day.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, a girl. Then you take Greylands' Rest. At least--I suppose so,&quot; added
Mr. Castlemaine doubtfully. &quot;My brother Basil made a will?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, yes. He made a fresh will as soon as he heard of his father's death. He
bequeathed Greylands' Rest (assuming that it was then his) to Anthony and to his
sons, should he have any, in succession after him: failing sons, he left it to
me after Anthony.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That is all legal then. Until to-morrow morning, George.&quot;</p>
<p>With a pressure of the hand, the Master of Greylands went down the path to
his house, and let himself in with his latchkey. The doors were closed, the
blinds were down; for tidings of Harry's death were already carried there. He
went straight up to that solitary room, and shut himself in with his bitter
trouble.</p>
<p>He was not a cruel man, or a vindictive man, or a covetous man. No, nor a
false man, save in that one unhappy business relating to his nephew Anthony. All
his efforts for many a year had been directed to ward off suspicion from the
doings of the Friar's Keep: and when Anthony so unexpectedly appeared, his
rejection of his claims had not been for the sake of retaining the revenues that
were not his, but because he would not, if he could help it, quit the house. The
one short sentence just spoken to George, &quot;I have put by the revenues since my
father's death,&quot; conveyed a true fact. Mr. Castlemaine did not wish for the
revenues or intend to appropriate them, unless he was assured that his brother
Basil and Basil's heirs had alike failed. He would have liked to send Anthony
back to France, pay him what was due, and buy the estate from him. To have had
the fraudulent doings discovered and brought home to him would have been to the
Master of Greylands worse than death. It was to keep them secret that he
discouraged the sojourn of strangers at Greylands; that he did not allow Harry
to enter on an intimacy with any visitors who might be staying there: and of
late he had shown an impatience, in spite of his liking for him, for the
departure of the gentleman-artist, George North. His dislike of the Grey Sisters
had its sole origin in this. He always dreaded that their attention might be
attracted some night to the boats, putting off from the contraband vessel; and
he would have shut up the Grey Nunnery had it been in his power. That Mary
Ursula, with her certain income, small though it was, should have joined the
Sisterhood, tried him sorely; both from this secret reason and for her own sake.
Nearly as good, he thought, that she had been buried alive.</p>
<p>It was all over now, and the end had come. The last cargo had now been run,
the lucrative trade and its dash of lawless excitement had been stopped for
ever. This would not have troubled him: he was getting tired of it, he was
getting afraid of it: but it had left its dreadful consequences in its train;
dealt, as may be said, a final death-blow at parting. Harry Castlemaine had
passed away, and with him the heart's life of the Master of Greylands.</p>

<h5>REBELLION.</h5>
<br>

<p>&quot;It is the most ridiculously sentimental piece of business that I ever heard
of in my life!&quot; spoke Mrs. Castlemaine, in a tone between a sob and a shriek.</p>
<p>&quot;Nevertheless, it is what <i>must be</i>,&quot; said her husband. &quot;It is decided
upon.&quot;</p>
<p>The morrow had come. George North--but we must put aside that name now--was
at Greylands' Rest, and had held his further private conference with Mr.
Castlemaine. The latter knew who Madame Guise was now, and all about it, and the
motive of her residence in his house. He did not know of her having visited his
bureau and seen the ring. He never would know it. Partial reticence was
necessary on both sides, and each had somewhat to be ashamed of that the other
did not suspect or dream of.</p>
<p>George Castlemaine, lying awake that night at the Dolphin Inn--his whole
heart aching for his uncle, his saddest regrets, past and present, given to his
brother and his cousin--had been, to use a familiar saying, turning matters
about in his mind, to see what was the best that might be made of them.
Greylands' Rest was his: there was no question of that; and he must and should
take possession of it, and make it his abode for the future. But he hated to be
the means of throwing discredit on his uncle: and this step would naturally
throw on him discredit in men's minds. If Greylands' Rest was the younger
brother George's now, it must have been the elder brother Anthony's before him:
and all the deceit, suspected of the Master of Greylands earlier in the year,
would be confirmed. Was there any way of preventing this? George thought there
was. And he lay dwelling on this and other difficulties until morning, and found
his way.</p>
<p>&quot;The world need never know that it was Anthony's, Uncle James,&quot; he said,
wringing his uncle's hand to give force to his argument. &quot;Let it be supposed
that the estate was only to lapse to him after Harry--that Harry came in first
by my grandfather's will. None can dispute it. And you can make a merit, you
know, of giving it up at once to me, not caring to remain here now Harry is
gone.&quot;</p>
<p>A gleam of light, like a bit of blue sky suddenly shining out of leaden
clouds, dawned on Mr. Castlemaine's face. The prospect of tacitly confessing
himself a traitor before his fellow men had made a large ingredient in his cup
of bitterness.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing need ever be specially proclaimed,&quot; resumed George. &quot;Nobody in the
world has a right to inquire into our affairs, to say to us, How is this? or,
How is that? It can be <i>understood</i> that this is the case. Even to your
own--your own family&quot;--(the word on George's tongue had been &quot;wife,&quot; but he
changed it)--&quot;you need not give other explanation. Let this be so, Uncle James.
It is for the honour of the Castlemaines.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, yes; it would take a load from me--if--if it may be done,&quot; said the
Master of Greylands dreamily. &quot;I see no reason why it should not be,&quot; he added,
after consideration. &quot;It lies, George, with you. You alone know the truth.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then that is settled. Be assured, Uncle James, that I shall never betray it.
I shall accustom myself to <i>think</i> that it is so; that I only came in after
Harry; in time I daresay I shall quite believe it.&quot;</p>
<p>And so, as George said, it was a settled thing. That version of the affair
went abroad, and James Castlemaine's credit was saved.</p>
<p>His credit had also to be saved on another score: the death of Anthony. The
fact, that he was dead, could no longer be kept from the curious neighbourhood:
at least, it would have been in the highest degree inexpedient not to clear it
up: but the Master of Greylands' knowledge of it might still be denied and
concealed. The exact truth in regard to his death, the true particulars of it,
might be made known: Anthony had found his way down to the lower vaults of the
Friar's Keep, that night; had pounced upon the smugglers, then running a cargo;
they had shot him dead, and then flung him into the sea. The smugglers were
doing their work alone that night, Commodore Teague not being with them, and
they were the sole authors of the calamity. Every word of this was correct, and
George would enlighten the world with this, and no more. If questions were put
to him as to how he came into possession of the facts, he would avow that the
smugglers had confessed it to him, now that their visits to the coast were at an
end for ever. He would say that the man who shot him had taken Anthony to be a
coastguardsman: and this was fact also: for Van Stan said afterwards that in the
surprise and confusion he <i>had</i> thought this; had thought that the
preventive-men were on them. The Master of Greylands would hold his own as to
his ignorance and innocence: and Mr. John Bent must go on working out the
puzzle, of having fancied he saw him that night, to the end.</p>
<p>Neither need Madame Guise be quite entirely enlightened. George, a
Castlemaine himself and jealous of the family's good name, would not, even to
her, throw more discredit than need be on his father's brother. He would not
tell her that Mr. Castlemaine had been one with the smugglers; but he would tell
her that he knew of the practices and kept silence out of regard to Commodore
Teague. He would disclose to her the full details of that night, as they
occurred, but <i>not</i> that Mr. Castlemaine had been at all upon the beach,
before Anthony or after him; he would say that when Anthony's fate was disclosed
to him, and the ring handed over, the most lively regret and sorrow for him took
possession of his uncle, but to proclaim that he had been made cognisant of it
would have done no good whatever, and ruined the Commodore. Well, so far, that
was all true, and Charlotte Guise must make the best of it. Mr. Castlemaine
intimated that he should settle a sum of money upon the little child, Marie; and
the revenues of Greylands' Rest for the period intervening between his father's
death and Anthony's death would, of course, be paid over to Charlotte. George,
while this was being spoken of, privately resolved to take on himself the
educational expenses of the child.</p>
<p>It was in Mr. Castlemaine's room that this conference with George took place.
Mr. Castlemaine unlocked the bureau, produced the ring, and placed it on
George's finger. George took it off.</p>
<p>&quot;I think his wife should have this, Uncle James. She may like to keep it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who gave it to Anthony?&quot; asked Mr. Castlemaine.</p>
<p>&quot;My mother. It had belonged to her father, and to his father before him. She
gave it to Anthony before she died, telling him it was an heirloom and charging
him ever to wear it in remembrance of her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then I think it should now be worn by you, George; but settle it with Madame
Guise as you will. Who was your mother? An Englishwoman?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yes. Miss North. It was her brother, Mr. George North, who stood
godfather to me, and who left me all his private fortune. He was in the silk
mills, and died quite a young man and a bachelor.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; said Mr. Castlemaine, rather dreamily, his thoughts back with his
brother Basil, &quot;you have money, George, I know. Is it much?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is altogether nearly a thousand pounds a year. Some of it came to me from
my father.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And Ethel has about seven hundred a year,&quot; remarked Mr. Castlemaine. &quot;And
there will be the revenues of Greylands' Rest: twelve hundred, or thereabouts.
You will be a rich man, George, and can keep up as much state as you please
here.&quot;</p>
<p>It will be seen by this that George Castlemaine had asked his uncle for
Ethel. Mr. Castlemaine was surprised: he had not entertained the remotest
suspicion of any attachment between them: but he gave a hearty consent. He had
liked George; he was fond of Ethel; and the match for her was excellent.</p>
<p>&quot;I would just as soon not take her away with us when we leave, except as a
temporary arrangement,&quot; was his candid avowal. &quot;Mrs. Castlemaine does not make
her home too pleasant; she will be happier with you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I hope so!&quot; was the hasty, fervent answer.</p>
<p>The conference, which had been a long one, broke up. George went away to his
interview of explanation with Madame Guise, who as yet knew nothing; and the
Master of Greylands summoned his wife to the room. He informed her briefly of
the state of things generally: telling her who George North was, and of
Anthony's death: using the version that George had suggested, and keeping
himself, as to the past, on neutral ground altogether. <i>She</i> was not to
know even as much as Madame Guise, but to understand, as the world would, that
her husband only learnt the truth now. Now that poor Harry was gone, he said,
George came next in the succession to Greylands' Rest, and he (Mr. Castlemaine)
had resolved to give it up to him at once. Mrs. Castlemaine, who did not feel at
all inclined to quit Greylands' Rest, went into a state of rebellions
indignation forthwith, and retorted with the remark already given.</p>
<p>&quot;Why 'must' it be?&quot; she asked. &quot;Where lies the obligation?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing would induce me to remain in this house now Harry is gone,&quot; he
answered. &quot;I wish I was away from it already: the reminiscences connected with
it are so painful that I can bear to stay in it for the short while that we must
stay. When a blight like this falls upon a family, Sophia, it frequently brings
changes in its train.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Castlemaine, biting her lips in temper, was not ready with a rejoinder.
In the face of this plea, her stepson's death, it would not be decent to say too
much. Moreover, though her husband was an excellent man in regard to allowing
her full sway in trifles, she knew by experience that when it came to momentous
affairs, she might as well attempt to turn the sea as to interfere with his
will.</p>
<p>&quot;I like Greylands' Rest,&quot; she said. &quot;I have lived in it since you brought me
home. Flora was born here. It is very hard to have to hear of leaving it.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Castlemaine had his back to her, tearing up some papers that were in a
drawer of his bureau. It looked exactly as though he were already making
preparations for the exit.</p>
<p>&quot;And I expected that this would have been my home for life,&quot; she added more
angrily, his silence increasing her feelings of rebellion.</p>
<p>&quot;No, you did not expect it,&quot; said he, turning round. &quot;I heard my father
inform you, the very day after you came here, that Greylands' Rest would descend
to his eldest son; not to me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It <i>did</i> descend to you,&quot; was all she said.</p>
<p>&quot;But it is mine no longer. Harry is gone, and I resign it to my eldest
brother's only remaining son.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is <i>absurd</i> chivalry even to think of such a thing,&quot; she retorted,
her lip quivering, her throat swelling. &quot;One would fancy you had taken leave of
your senses, James.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The less said about the matter the better,&quot; he answered, turning to his
papers again. &quot;At Greylands' Rest, now my son is gone, I cannot and will not
stay: and George North--George Castlemaine--comes into possession of it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you resign to him the income of the estate as well as the house?&quot;
inquired Mrs. Castlemaine, as much mockery in her tone as she dared to use.</p>
<p>&quot;The arrangements I choose to make with him are my own, Sophia, and are
private between himself and me. Whithersoever I may go, I shall take as good an
income with me as you have enjoyed here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And where shall you go?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think at first we will travel for a bit. You have often expressed a wish
for that. Afterwards we shall see. Perhaps you would like to settle in London,
and for myself I care very little where it is.&quot;</p>
<p>A vision of the seductions of London--its shops, its shows, its theatres, its
gay life generally--rose attractively, as in a vision, before Mrs. Castlemaine.
She had never been to the metropolis in her life, and quite believed its streets
were paved with gold.</p>
<p>&quot;One thing I <i>am</i> surprised at, James,&quot; she resumed quitting that bone
of contention for another. &quot;That you should give consent off hand, as you tell
me you have done, to Ethel's marriage with a stranger.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A stranger! We have seen a good deal of him in the past few months; and he
is my nephew.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But a very disreputable kind of nephew. Really I must say it! He has
concealed his name from us, and has aided and abetted that governess in
concealing hers! It is <i>not</i> reputable.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I have explained the cause to you. The poor woman came to the place to
seek out her husband, and thought she should have a better chance of success if
she dropped his name and appeared as a stranger. George came over in his turn,
and at her request dropped his. Remember one thing, Sophia, the concealment has
not injured us; and Madame Guise has at least been an efficient governess for
Flora, and done her duty well.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I should certainly think twice before I gave him Ethel. Such haste! I don't
see&quot; (and here a little bit of the true animus peeped out) &quot;why Ethel should
have the pleasure of staying on at Greylands' Rest for good, while I and Flora
are to be forced to leave it!&quot;</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>&quot;All the pleasant places of the dear child!--that have been hers from
childhood--that she has grown up attached to! Her very swing in the garden!--the
doll's house in the nursery! Everything.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She can take her swing and her doll's house with her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And for that Ethel to stay, and come in for all the benefit! If she must
marry George North I should at least make her wait a twelvemonth.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They shall be married as soon as they please,&quot; said Mr. Castlemaine. &quot;He
will make her a good husband; I am sure of it: and his means are large. Her home
with him will be happier than you have allowed it to be with us: I did not
forget that in my decision.&quot;</p>
<p>The lips of Mrs. Castlemaine were being bitten to nothing. Whatever she said
seemed to get twisted and turned against her. But she fully intended at some
more auspicious moment, when her husband should be in a less uncompromising
mood, to have another trial at retaining Greylands' Rest. If she had but known
the real truth!--that it was George Castlemaine's by inheritance, and had been
his since that past February night!</p>
<p>Meanwhile George himself was with Madame Guise, making known to her the
elucidation of many things and of the manner of Anthony's death. Poor Charlotte
Guise, demonstrative as are most French women sobbed and exclaimed as she
listened, and found that what she had feared was indeed a certainty. It was the
shot of that fatal February night that had killed her husband: the scream heard
had been his death-scream. She was in truth a widow and her child fatherless.</p>
<p>But, when the first shock lifted itself--and it was perhaps less keenly felt
in consequence of what may be called these many long months of preparation for
it--her thoughts turned to Mr. Castlemaine. The certainty that he was
innocent--for she implicitly believed her brother-in-law's version of the
past--brought to her unspeakable relief. Prejudice apart, she had always liked
Mr. Castlemaine: and she now felt ashamed for having doubted him. &quot;If I had but
taken the courage to declare myself to him at first, and what my mission was in
England, I might have been spared all this dreadful suspicion and torment!&quot; she
cried, her tears dropping softly. &quot;And it has been a torment, I assure you,
George, to live in the same house with Mr. Castlemaine, believing him guilty.
And oh! to think that I should have opened that bureau! Will he ever forgive
me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You must not tell him of that,&quot; said George gravely. &quot;I speak in your
interest alone, Charlotte. It would answer no good end to declare it; and, as it
happened, no harm was done.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No harm but to me,&quot; she moaned. &quot;Since I saw that ring, my fears of Mr.
Castlemaine and my own trouble have increased tenfold.&quot;</p>
<p>George held out the ring, saying that Mr. Castlemaine had just handed it to
him. &quot;He says,&quot; continued George, &quot;that the one problem throughout it all which
he could not solve, was why Anthony's friends never came over to institute a
search for him, or made inquiry by letter.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, yes,&quot; said Madame Guise, &quot;there have been problems on all sides, no
doubt--and the looking back at them seems quite to bewilder me.&quot;</p>
<p>She had been slipping the sparkling diamond ring on and off her slender
finger that wore the wedding-ring. &quot;Take it, George,&quot; she said, giving it back
to him.</p>
<p>&quot;Nay, it is yours, Charlotte: not mine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But no,&quot; she answered in some surprise. &quot;This is your family's ring,
bequeathed to you by your mother. Anthony would have worn it always had he
lived; you must wear it now. Let me put it on for you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It might be a consolation to you to keep it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have other relics of Anthony's. There is his watch, and the chain; and
there must be some little treasures in his desk. Mr. Bent will hand them over to
me when he knows who I am. But as to this ring, George, I have no claim to it:
nor would I keep it while you and Emma live.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Were his watch and chain saved?&quot; exclaimed George.</p>
<p>&quot;Why yes. Did you never hear that? Mr. Bent keeps them locked up with the
other things. Anthony had been writing in his parlour that night at the Dolphin,
you know; it was supposed that he put off his watch to look how the time went:
at any rate it was found on the table the next morning by the side of his desk.&quot;</p>
<p>George sighed deeply. All these trifles connected with his brother's last day
on earth were so intensely painful. Never, as he fully believed, should he look
at the glittering ring, now on his finger, without recalling Anthony to memory.
Charlotte sat down and burst into renewed tears.</p>
<p>&quot;Where is Ethel?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>&quot;She was in the schoolroom just now, crying. Ah, George, she feels Mr.
Harry's death very much: she liked him as a brother.&quot;</p>
<p>George proceeded to the schoolroom. As he was entering, Flora darted out, her
eyes swollen, her cheeks enflamed. She, too, had loved her half-brother, for all
her careless ways and his restraining hand. George would have detained her to
speak a kind word, but she suddenly dipped her head and flew past, under his
arm.</p>
<p>Ethel was not crying now. She stood by the fire, leaning her pretty head
against the mantelpiece. Her back was towards the door, and she was not aware
that it was George who entered.</p>
<p>&quot;My darling, I fear this is a sad trial to you,&quot; he said, advancing.</p>
<p>His voice brought to her a start of surprise; his words caused the tears to
flow again. George drew her to him, and she sobbed on his breast.</p>
<p>&quot;You don't know what it is,&quot; she said quite hysterically. &quot;I used to be at
times cross and angry with him. And now I find there was no cause for it, that
he was married all the while. Oh if I had but known!--he should never have heard
from me an unkind word.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Be assured of one thing, Ethel--that he appreciated your words at their
proper due only, and laughed at them in his heart. He knew you loved him as a
brother: and I am sure he was truly attached to you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I do know all that. But--I wish I had been always kind to him,&quot; she
added, as she drew away and stood as before.</p>
<p>&quot;I come from a long talk with Mr. Castlemaine,&quot; said George, after a minute's
pause, putting his elbow on the opposite end of the mantel piece to face her
while he spoke &quot;I have been asking him for you, Ethel.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ye--s?&quot; she faltered, her eyes glancing up for a moment, and then falling
again. &quot;Asking him to-day?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are thinking that it is not the most appropriate day I could have
chosen: and that's true. But, in one sense, I did not choose it. We had future
plans of different kinds to discuss, and this one had to come in with them. I
come to make a confession to you, Ethel, to crave your pardon. The name under
which I have won you, George North, is not my true name. At least, not all my
name. I am a Castlemaine. Mr. Castlemaine's nephew, and that poor lost Anthony's
brother.&quot;</p>
<p>Ethel looked bewildered. &quot;A Castlemaine!&quot; she repeated. &quot;How can that be?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My dear, it is easy to understand. Mr. Basil Castlemaine, he who settled
abroad, was the eldest brother of this house, you know, years ago. Anthony was
Basil's elder son, I his younger. I came over to discover what I could of
Anthony's fate, and I dropped temporarily the name of Castlemaine, lest my being
recognised as one of the family might impede my search. My uncle James condones
it all; and I believe he thinks that I was justified. I have now resumed my
name--George North Castlemaine.&quot;</p>
<p>Ethel drew a deep breath. She was trying to recover her astonishment.</p>
<p>&quot;Would it pain you very much, Ethel, to know that you would make no change in
your residence?--that you would spend your life at Greylands' Rest?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I--do not understand you,&quot; she faintly said, a vision of remaining under
Mrs. Castlemaine's capricious control for ever, and of being separated from <i>
him</i>, rushing over her like an ugly nightmare.</p>
<p>&quot;Greylands' Rest is to be my home in future, Ethel. Mr. and Mrs. Castlemaine
leave it----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yours!--your own?&quot; she interrupted in excitement. &quot;This house! Greylands'
Rest?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes; my own. It is mine now. I come in after Harry,&quot; he added very
hurriedly, to cover the last sentence, which had slipped out inadvertently: &quot;and
my uncle resigns it to, me at once.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh dear,&quot; said Ethel, more and more bewildered. &quot;But it would cost so much
to live <i>here</i>.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not more than I can afford to spend,&quot; he answered with a smile. &quot;I told you,
Ethel, if you remember, that I expected to come into some property, though I was
not sure of it. I have come into it. What would have been poor Anthony's had he
lived, is now mine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But--is Anthony really dead?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ay. I will tell you about it later. The present question is, Ethel, whether
you will share my home here at Greylands' Rest.&quot;</p>
<p>He spoke with a smile, crossed over, and stood before her on the shabby old
hearthrug. Just one moment of maiden hesitation, of a sweet rising blush, and
she bent forward to the arms that were opened to encircle her.</p>
<p>&quot;One home together here,&quot; he fondly murmured, bending his face on hers. &quot;One
Heaven hereafter.&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>

<h4><a name="div1_39" href="#div1Ref_39">CHAPTER XXXIX.</a></h4>
<h5>NO TURNING BACK.</h5>
<br>

<p>Once more the whole population of Greylands turned out in commotion. A sad
and silent commotion, however, this time, as befitted the cause. Voices were
hushed to a low tone, faces showed sadness, the church bell was tolling. People
had donned their best attire; the fishermen were in their churchgoing clothes,
their boats, hauled up on the beach or lying at anchor, had rest to-day. All who
could muster a scrap of mourning had put it on, though it was but an old crape
hatband, or a bit of black bonnet-ribbon. Mr. Harry Castlemaine was about to be
buried; and he had been a favourite with high and low.</p>
<p>They made their comments as they stood waiting for the funeral. The December
day was raw and dull, the grey skies seeming to threaten a fall of some kind;
but Mrs. Bent pronounced it not cold enough for snow. She stood at her front
door, wearing a black gown, and black strings to her cap; and was
condescendingly exchanging remarks with some of her inferior neighbours, and
with Mrs. and Miss Pike, who had run over from the shop.</p>
<p>&quot;We shall never have such a week o' surprises as this have been,&quot; pronounced
Mrs. Pike, a little red-faced woman, who was this morning in what she called
&quot;the thick of a wash,&quot; and consequently had come out en dshabille, a shawl
thrown over her cap, underneath which peeped out some black straggling curls.
&quot;First of all, about them smugglers and poor Mr. Harry's wound and death, and
that good-hearted Commodore having to decamp himself off, through them ferreting
coastguards. And now to hear that the gentleman staying here so long is one o'
the Castlemaines theirselves, and heir to Greylands' Rest after Mr. Harry! It
beats the news column in the Stilborough paper holla.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;'Twere a sad thing, though, about that young Mr. Anthony,&quot; exclaimed old Ben
Little. &quot;The smugglers shot him dead, ye see, and that scream Mr. Bent said he
heard were his. Full o' life one moment, and shot down the next! Them wretches
ought to have swung for it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It be a pack o' surprises, all on't, but the greatest on 'em be Jane
Hallet,&quot; quoth Nancy Gleeson. &quot;When it come out that Mr. Harry had married her,
you might ha' sent me down head for'ard with a feather--just as Mr. Harry sent
down our Tim one day, when he said a word again' her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was very sly of Jane,&quot; struck in Miss Susan Pike, tossing her curls.
&quot;Never saying a word to a body, and making believe as it was just talk about her
and Mr. Harry, and nothing else. I'd like to know how she wheedled him over.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's not for you to speak against her, Susan Pike,&quot; cried Mrs. Bent in her
sharpest tone. &quot;You didn't wheedle him, and wasn't likely to. She is Mr. Harry's
wife--widow, worse luck!--and by all accounts no blame's due to her. Mr.
Castlemaine gives none: and we heard yesterday he was going to settle two
hundred a year on her for life.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My! won't she set up for a lady!&quot; enviously returned Miss Pike, ignoring the
reprimand.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't you be jealous, and show it, Susan Pike,&quot; retorted Mrs. Bent.
&quot;Everybody liked Jane: and we are all glad--but you--that she's cleared from the
scandal. I did think it odd that <i>she</i> should go wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Her aunt have got her home now, and have took up all her proud airs again,&quot;
said Mrs. Pike, not pleased that her daughter should be put down. &quot;That Miss
Hallet have always thought none of us was good enough for her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hist!&quot; said Ben Little, in a hushed voice. &quot;Here it comes.&quot;</p>
<p>On the evening of the day following the death, the remains of Harry
Castlemaine, then in their first coffin, had been conveyed to his home. It was
from Greylands' Rest, therefore, that the funeral procession was now advancing.
The curious spectators stretched their necks aloft to watch its onward progress;
but as it came near they retreated into the hedges, so to say, and compressed
themselves into as small a space as possible; the men, with one accord, taking
off their hats.</p>
<p>It was a perfectly simple funeral. The state rather loved by the
Castlemaines, and hitherto maintained by the Master of Greylands, it had not
pleased him to extend to the obsequies of his son. Two mutes with their batons
of sable plumes were in advance; Parson Marston followed in his surplice and
black hood, walking at the head of the coffin, which was covered by its pall,
and carried by carriers. Close to the coffin came Mr. Castlemaine; his nephew,
George, accompanying him. Squire Dobie, long recovered from his illness, and Mr.
Knivett walked next; two gentlemen from Stilborough, and the doctors, Parker and
Croft, brought up the rear. These comprised all the ostensible mourners: they
wore crape scarfs and hat-bands that nearly swept the ground, and had white
handkerchiefs in their hands; but behind them were many followers: John Bent,
Superintendent Nettleby, and others, who had fallen in as the procession left
the house; and Miles and the other men-servants closed it.</p>
<p>Whether any suspicion penetrated to Mr. Superintendent Nettleby, then or
later, that it was not mere accident which had taken Harry to the secret vaults
of the Keep that night, cannot be known. He never gave utterance to it, then or
later.</p>
<p>The people came out of the hedges after it had passed, and followed it slowly
to the churchyard. Mr. Marston had turned and was waiting at the gate to receive
the coffin, reading his solemn words. And for once in his life Parson Marston
was solemn too.</p>
<p>&quot;<i>I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord: he that believeth in
Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth
in Me shall never die</i>.&quot;</p>
<p>A sob of pain, telling what this calamity was to him, rose in the throat of
the Master of Greylands. Few men could control themselves better than he: and he
struggled for calmness. If he gave way at this, the commencement of the service,
how should he hold out to the end? So his face took its pale impassive look
again, as he followed on through the churchyard.</p>
<p>It was not the custom at that time for women to attend the obsequies of those
in the better ranks of life. Women followed the poor, but never the rich.
Neither did any, save those bidden to a funeral, attempt to enter the church as
spectators: or at least, it was done but in very rare cases. The crowd who had
gathered by the Dolphin Inn, to watch it pass, took up their standing in the
churchyard. From time to time the voice of Mr. Marston was heard, and that of
the clerk in the Amens; and soon the procession was out again.</p>
<p>The grave--or rather the vault--of old Anthony Castlemaine, had been opened
in the churchyard, and Harry was laid there in it. His own mother was there: the
coffins lay two abreast. The Master of Greylands saw his wife's as he looked in.
The inscription was as plain as though she had been buried yesterday: &quot;Maria
Castlemaine. Aged twenty-six.&quot; Another sob shook his throat as Harry's was
lowered on it, and for a minute or two he broke down.</p>
<p>It was all soon over, and they filed out of the churchyard on their way back
to Greylands' Rest. Leaving the curious and sympathising crowd to watch the
grave-diggers, and lament one to another that the fine, open-hearted young man
had been taken away so summarily, and to elbow one another as they pushed round
to see the last of his coffin, and to read its name:</p>
<p>&quot;Henry Castlemaine. Aged twenty-six.&quot; So he had died at just the same age as
his mother!</p>
<p>Miss Castlemaine sat in the parlour at the Grey Nunnery, the little Marie on
her knee. Since she knew who this child was--a Mary Ursula, like herself, and a
Castlemaine--a new interest had arisen for her in her heart. She was holding the
little one to her, looking into her face, and tracing the resemblance to the
family. A great resemblance there undoubtedly was: the features were the
clearly-cut Castlemaine features, the eyes were the same dark lustrous eyes; and
Mary most wondered that the resemblance had never previously struck her.</p>
<p>Once more Mary had put aside the simple grey dress of the Sisterhood for
robes of mourning: flowing robes, they were, of silk and crape, worn for poor
Harry. The cap was on her head still, shading her soft brown hair.</p>
<p>It was the week subsequent to the funeral. On the following day Madame Guise
(as well retain the name to the last) was about to return to her own land with
her child, escorted thither by George Castlemaine. It was not to be a perpetual
separation, for Charlotte had faithfully promised to come over at least once in
three years to stay with George and Ethel at Greylands' Rest, so as to give her
child the privilege of keeping up relations with the Castlemaine family. A slab
was to be placed in the church to the memory of Anthony, and that, Madame Guise
said, would of itself bring her. She must afford herself the mournful
satisfaction of reading it from time to time. After her departure Mary Ursula
was to go to Greylands' Rest on a short farewell visit to her uncle. It would be
Christmastide, and she would spend the Christmas there. Mr. and Mrs. Castlemaine
were losing no time in their departure from Greylands' Rest; they would be gone,
with Ethel and Flora, before the new year came in. Mr. Castlemaine would not
stay in it to see the dawning of another year: the last one, he said, had been
too ill-fated. George would return as soon as might be to take up his abode
there--but travelling on the Continent was somewhat uncertain at that season.
During the winter Mr. and Mrs. Castlemaine would remain in London; and in the
spring George was to go up there for his marriage, and bring Ethel home.</p>
<p>&quot;Marie must not forget her English,&quot; said Mary Ursula, pressing a kiss on the
child's face.</p>
<p>&quot;Marie not fordet it, lady.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And Marie is to come sometimes and see her dear old friends here; mamma says
so; and Uncle George will----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A gentleman to see you, madam.&quot;</p>
<p>Little Sister Phoeby had opened the parlour door with the announcement, and
was showing the visitor in. Mary thought it must be Mr. Knivett, and wondered
that she had not heard the gate-bell. The fact was, Sister Phoeby had had the
front door open, to let out the school children.</p>
<p>It was not Mr. Knivett who entered, but a much younger man: one whom, of all
the world, Mary would have least expected to see--Sir William Blake-Gordon. He
came forward, holding out his hand with trepidation, his utterly colourless face
betraying his inward emotion. Mary rose, putting down the child, and
mechanically suffered her hand to meet his. Sister Phoeby beckoned out the
little girl, and shut the door.</p>
<p>&quot;Will you pardon my unauthorised intrusion?&quot; he asked, putting his hat on the
table and taking a chair near her. &quot;I feared to write and ask permission to
call, lest you should deny it to me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I should not have denied it--no; my friends are welcome here,&quot; replied Mary,
feeling just as agitated as he, but successfully repressing its signs. &quot;You
have, no doubt, some good reason for seeking me.&quot;</p>
<p>She spoke with one of her sweetest smiles: the smile that she was wont to
give to her best friends. How well he remembered it!</p>
<p>&quot;You have heard--at least I fancy you must have heard--some news of me,&quot;
resumed Sir William, speaking with considerable embarrassment and hesitation.
&quot;It has been made very public.&quot;</p>
<p>Mary coloured now. About a fortnight before, Mr. Knivett had told her that
the projected marriage of Sir William with Miss Mountsorrel was at an end. The
two lovers had quarrelled and parted. Sir William sat looking at Mary, either
waiting for her answer, or because he hesitated to go on.</p>
<p>&quot;I heard that something had occurred to interrupt your plans,&quot; said Mary. &quot;It
is only a temporary interruption, I trust.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is a lasting one,&quot; he said; &quot;and I do not wish it to be otherwise. Oh,
Mary!&quot; he added, rising in agitation, &quot;you know, you must know, how hateful it
was to me! I entered into it to please my father; I never had an iota of love
for her. Love! the very word is desecrated in connection with what I felt for
Miss Mountsorrel. I really and truly had not even friendship for her; I could
not feel it. When we parted, I felt like a man who has been relieved from some
heavy weight of dull despair; it was as though I had shaken off a felon's
chains.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What caused it?&quot; questioned Mary, feeling that she must say something.</p>
<p>&quot;Coolness caused it. For the very life of me I was unable to behave to her as
I ought--as I suppose she had a right to expect me to behave. Since my father's
death I had been more distant than ever, for I could not help remembering the
fact that, had I held out against his will until then, I should have been free:
and I resented it bitterly in my heart. Resented it on her, I fear. She
reproached me with my coolness one day--some two or three weeks ago, it is. One
word led to another; we had a quarrel and she threw me up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am sorry to hear it,&quot; said Mary.</p>
<p>&quot;Can you say that from your heart?&quot;</p>
<p>He put the subdued question so pointedly, and there was so wistful an
expression of reproach in his face that she felt confused. Sir William came up
close, and took her hands.</p>
<p>&quot;You know what I have come for,&quot; he cried, his voice hoarse with agitation.
&quot;I should have come a week ago but that it was the period of your deep mourning.
Oh, Mary! let it be with us as it used to be! There can be no happiness for me
in this world apart from you. Since the day of my father's death I have never
ceased to--to--I had almost said to <i>curse</i> the separation that he forced
upon us; or, rather to curse my weakness in yielding to it. Oh, my darling,
forgive me!--my early and only love, forgive me I Come to me Mary, and be my
dear wife!&quot;</p>
<p>The tears were running down her face. Utterly unnerved, feeling how entirely
the old love was holding sway in her heart, she let her hands lie in his.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not rich, as you know, Mary; but we shall have enough for comfort. Your
position at least, as Lady Blake Gordon, will be assured, and neither of us
cares for riches. Our tastes are alike simple. Do you remember how we both used
to laugh at undue parade and show?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hush, William! Don't tempt me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not tempt you! My dear one, you must be mine. It was a sin to separate us:
it would be a worse sin to prolong the separation now that impediments are
removed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot turn back,&quot; she said. &quot;I have cast my lot in here, and must abide
by it. I--I--seem to see--to see more surely and clearly day by day as the days
go on&quot;--she could scarcely speak for agitation--&quot;that God Himself has led me to
this life; that He is showing me hour by hour how to be more useful in it. I may
not quit it now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you recall the fact, Mary, that your father <i>gave</i> you to me? It was
his will that we should be man and wife. You cannot refuse to hear my prayer.&quot;</p>
<p>None knew, or ever would know, what that moment was to Mary Ursula: how
strong was the temptation that assailed her; how cruelly painful to resist it.
But, while seductive love showed her the future, as his wife, in glowing
colours, reason forbade her yielding to it. Argument after argument against it
crowded into her mind. She had cast in her lot with these good ladies; she had
made the poor patient community, struggling before with need and privation,
happy with her means. How could she withdraw those means from them? She had, in
her own heart, and doing it secretly as to Christ, taken up her cross and her
work in this life that she had entered upon. When she embraced it, she embraced
it for ever: to turn away from it now would be like a mockery of Heaven.
Involuntarily there arose in her mind a warning verse of Holy Writ, strangely
applicable. She thought it might almost have been written for her; and a
breathed word of silent prayer went up from her heart that she might be helped
and strengthened.</p>
<p>&quot;You know, Mary, that Mr. Peter Castlemaine----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just a moment, William,&quot; she interrupted, lifting her hand pleadingly. &quot;Let
me think it out.&quot;</p>
<p>There were worldly reasons also why she should not yield, she went on to
think: ay, and perhaps social ones. What would the public say if, during this
temporary estrangement from Agatha Mountsorrel, this trumpery quarrel, she were
to seize upon him again with indecent haste, and make him her own? What would
her own sense of right say to it?--her maidenly propriety?--her untarnished
spirit of honour? No, it could not be: the world might cry shame on her, and she
should cry it on herself. Sir William Blake-Gordon interrupted her with his
impassioned words. This moment, as it should be decided, seemed to be to him as
one of life or death.</p>
<p>&quot;William, hush!&quot; she said, gazing at him through her blinding tears, and
clasping his hands, in which hers still rested, almost to pain in her mind's
anguish. &quot;It may not be.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sit you down, my love, and be calm. I am sure you are hardly conscious of
what you say. Oh, Mary, reflect! It is our whole life's happiness that is at
stake: yours and mine.&quot;</p>
<p>They sat down side by side; and when her emotion had subsided she told him
why it might not, giving all the reasons for her decision, and speaking quietly
and firmly. He pleaded as though he were pleading for life itself, as well as
its happiness: but he pleaded in vain. All the while she was repeating to
herself that verse of warning, as if she dreaded letting it go from her for a
moment.</p>
<p>&quot;We will be as dear brother and sister, William, esteeming each other unto
our lives' end, and meeting occasionally. You will still marry Agatha----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mary!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I think it will be so; and I hope and trust you will be happy together.
I am sure you will be.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Our time together is short enough to-day, Mary. Do not waste it in these
idle words. If you knew how they grate on me!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I will leave that. But you must not waste your life in impossible
thoughts of me and of what might have been. It would render impracticable our
intercourse as friends. Thank you for what you have come this day to say: it
will make my heart happier when its tumult and agitation shall be over.&quot;</p>
<p>Once more, by every argument in his power to call up, by the deep love and
despair at his heart, he renewed his pleading. But it did not answer. The
interview was prolonged to quite an unusual period, and was painful on both
sides, but it terminated at length; and when William Blake-Gordon left her
presence he left it as her lover for ever.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h4><a name="div1_Conclusion" href="#div1Ref_Conclusion">CONCLUSION.</a></h4>
<br>

<p>Winter had passed: summer had come round again. Greylands basked in the light
and heat of the June sun; the sea lay sleeping under the fishing boats.</p>
<p>There's not much to tell. Greylands' Rest had its new inmates: George
Castlemaine and his wife. Ethel told her secrets to her husband now instead of
to the sea: but they both were fond of sitting on the high cliffs together and
watching its waves. Mr. and Mrs. Castlemaine were somewhere abroad, intending to
stay there until autumn: and Miss Flora was where poor Harry always said she
ought to be--at a good school. Mr. Castlemaine had carried his point, in spite
of the opposition of his wife. It must be one of two things, he said: either
that Mrs. Castlemaine stayed in England herself, or else that she disposed in
some way of Flora; for Flora he was fully determined not to have abroad with
him. So, being bent upon the foreign travel, Mrs. Castlemaine had to yield.</p>
<p>Jane Hallet--old names stand by us--had taken up her abode again with her
aunt, in the pretty home on the cliff. It would probably be her dwelling-place
for life. Unless, indeed, she carried out the project she had been heard once to
mention--that, whenever her aunt should be called away, she hoped to join the
community of the Grey Sisters. Very sad and gentle and subdued did Jane look in
her widow's cap. There was a little stone now in the churchyard to the memory of
&quot;Jane, infant child of Harry Castlemaine:&quot; it had been placed there, unasked, by
the Master of Greylands; and just as Jane used to steal down the cliff in the
dusk of evening to meet her husband, so did she now often steal down at the same
silent hour to weep over the graves of her child and its father, lying side by
side. Not yet did Greylands, as a rule, give her her true name: old names, it
has been just observed, stand by us: and Hallet, as applied to Jane, was more
familiar to the tongue than Castlemaine. The income settled on Jane was ample
for every comfort: she and her aunt now lived as quiet gentle-people, keeping a
good servant. Jane had dropped her intimacy with Miss Susan Pike, though she
would stay and speak cordially to her when by chance they met. Which implied
distance, or reserve, or whatever it might be, was not at all agreeable to that
damsel, and she consoled herself by telling Greylands that Jane was &quot;stuck-up.&quot;
Little cared poor Jane. Her young life had always been a sad one: and now,
before she was twenty years of age, its happiness had been blighted out of it.
George Castlemaine and his wife, at Greylands' Rest, were becoming fond of Jane:
Ethel had always liked her. Jane visited them now sometimes; and Greylands was
shown that they respected and regarded her.</p>
<p>&quot;It is as it should be: Jane's manners and ways were always too high for her
pocket--as are Miss Hallet's, too, for that matter,&quot; remarked Mrs. Bent to her
husband, one day that they sat sunning themselves on the bench outside the inn,
and saw Jane pass with Ethel. John only nodded in reply. With the elucidation of
the fate of Anthony Castlemaine, and the delivering over of his effects to his
widow, Charlotte Guise, John's mind was at rest, and he had returned to his old
easy apathy. By dint of much battling with strong impressions, John had come to
the conclusion that the tall man he saw cross from the Chapel Lane to the ruins,
that February night, might have been one of the smugglers on his way from the
Hutt, who bore an extraordinary resemblance to the Master of Greylands. Jack
Tuff held out still that it was he; but Jack Tuff was told his eyesight that
night could not be trusted.</p>
<p>News came from Commodore Teague pretty often. He appeared to be flourishing
in his new abode over the water, and had set up a pleasure-boat on the Scheldt.
He sent pressing messages for Greylands to visit him and Tom Dance and his son
intended to avail themselves of the invitation. The Commodore inquired after old
friends, even to the ghost of the Grey Monk, whether it &quot;walked&quot; as much as it
used to walk, or whether it didn't. The Hutt remained without a tenant. Not a
soul would take it. Events had severely shaken the bravery of Greylands; the
ghost had shown itself much in the last year, and the Hutt was too near its
haunting place, the Friar's Keep, to render it a comfortable residence. So it
remained untenanted, and was likely to remain so. Greylands would almost as soon
have parted with its faith in the Bible as in the Grey Monk.</p>
<p>And the participation of the Master of Greylands in those illicit practices
was not disclosed or suspected, and the name and reputation of the Castlemaines
had never a tarnish on it. It was believed that he had behaved in a remarkably
handsome and liberal manner to his nephew George, in giving up to him Greylands'
Rest during his own lifetime: George himself spoke feelingly of it: and what
with that, and what with the sympathy felt for the loss of his son, and what
with regret for the suspicions cast on him in regard to Anthony, Mr. Castlemaine
stood higher in men's estimation than ever he had stood originally. And that was
saying a great deal.</p>
<p>And she--Mary Ursula! Some further good fortune had come to her in the shape
of money. A heavy debt due to her father since long years, which had been looked
upon as a total loss, was suddenly repaid. It amounted, with the interest, to
many thousands of pounds. As Mr. Peter Castlemaine had himself not a creditor in
the world, all his obligations having been paid in full, it lapsed of course to
his daughter. So, even on the score of fortune, she might not have been so
unequal a match for Sir William Blake-Gordon. Sir William, knowing how utterly
at an end was all hope of Mary, had, after some tardy delay, renewed his
engagement with Miss Mountsorrel: and this month, June, they had been married.
Mary sent them a loving letter of good wishes, and a costly present: and she
told them that she and they should always be the best of friends.</p>
<p>She was too rich now, she was wont to say, laughingly, to the Sisters: and
she introduced some changes for comfort into the Nunnery. One of the rooms
hitherto shut up, a spacious apartment with the lovely sea view, she had caused
to be renovated and furnished for the Ladies, leaving the parlour still as the
reception-room. A smaller apartment with the same sea aspect was fitted up for
herself, and her own fine piano placed in it: the Superior's private
sitting-room. Sister Mildred had neither the means nor had she been educated
with the tastes of Mary Ursula. The door leading from the Nunnery into the
secret passage was bricked-up for ever.</p>
<p>A grand, stately Superior-mistress made Miss Castlemaine; and the Grey
Ladies, under her wise and gracious sway, enlarged their sphere of benevolence.
Using her means, they sought out their fellow-pilgrims, entangled amid the
thorns of this world, and helped them on the road to a better. For herself,
though anxiously fulfilling all the social obligations of her sphere here, she
kept her feet and her heart set ever towards the eternal shore. And if--for she
was but human--a regret came over her for the position she had persisted in
resigning, or a vision rose of the earthly bliss that would have been hers as
William Blake-Gordon's wife, that one verse of the loving MASTER'S, delivered to
His people during His sojourn on earth, was sure to suggest itself for her
consolation. As it had come into her mind, uncalled for and unbidden, during
that hour of her temptation, so would it return to cheer and comfort her now.</p>
<p>&quot;<i>No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit to
enter the kingdom of God</i>.&quot;</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
